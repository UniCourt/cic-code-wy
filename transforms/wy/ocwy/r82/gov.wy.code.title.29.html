       Company furnishing materials for construction, but not installing materials, deemed “materialman,” not “contractor.” —

     </p>
     <p>
      
   A company who entered a contract with the record owner of real property to furnish materials for the construction of a home on the property, but installed no materials into the new home, was a “materialman,” not a “contractor,” and had to file its lien statement within the 90-day time period provided by § 29-2-106(a). Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Walters, 707 P.2d 733, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 585</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

       Notice of intention to file lien sent to present owners of property. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      
   Inasmuch as the lien claimant failed to comply with the statutory requirement of giving proper notice to the owners of the property at the time the notice of intention to file lien was sent, although these parties were not the record owners at the time the claimant entered into a contract to supply materials to the then record owner, the lien was ineffective.

An argument that a printed version did not contain a session law relating to the effectiveness of the new statute was rejected because enrolled bills governed over incorrect or incomplete printed versions.

   of a particular class of creditors and to prevent unjust enrichment arising out of the enhancement of value of property from labor and materials which would otherwise go without payment. Engle v. First Nat'l Bank, 590 P.2d 826, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 362</cite> (Wyo. 1979).

   Former statute that required prompt lien notice applies to projects under construction prior to the effective date of the statute requiring 5 days' notice; therefore, a lien was improperly invalidated because prompt notice was given where a week passed that included a weekend and a legal holiday. An argument that a printed version did not contain a session law relating to the effectiveness of the new statute was rejected because enrolled bills governed over incorrect or incomplete printed versions.

   When a contract concerns the construction of improvements to real property, “contractor” has a specialized meaning related to the building trades; and it is in this sense that “contractor” is connected to the law of mechanics' liens.

   Although a contractor approved a subcontractor's invoices in excess of the target price without increasing the amount in writing as specified in the contract, the labor and materials were furnished under a contract and did not exceed the contract price because the claimed lien amount had been approved under the contract by the conduct of the parties.

    Basic purpose of lien statutes
    

   is that they are intended to create a new means of securing the claims of particular classes of creditors and to prevent unjust enrichment arising from the enhancement in value of property from work and materials expended thereon which would otherwise go without payment. United Pac. Ins. Co. v. Martin &amp; Luther Gen. Contractors, 455 P.2d 664, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 142</cite> (Wyo. 1969).

    Basic principle underlying all mechanics' lien statutes is one of equity,

   Even though the mechanics' lien statutes authorize the entry of personal judgments against the contractor-debtor under this section a lien foreclosure action, resulting in such judgments, cannot be considered an action “for the recovery of money only, or specific real or personal property,” within the meaning of Rule 38 (a), W.R.C.P. An action for foreclosure of a mechanic's lien is an equitable proceeding and, as contemplated by Rule 38 (a), W.R.C.P., should be triable by the court without a jury. It is principally an action to bind the property of the owner whose premises have been improved by the labor or materials furnished by the lien claimant for that purpose. True v. Hi-Plains Elevator Mach., 577 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 281</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

   The provisions of this section were evidently incorporated for the owner's protection, and to accomplish the full purpose thereof, the owner has a clear right to insist that the contractor be made a party, if possible, so that he may be bound by the judgment. While no personal judgment can be rendered against the contractor in such a suit unless there has been service of summons upon him within the state, he may nevertheless, if a nonresident of the state, be brought in as a party, for the statutes provided for constructive service in such a case pursuant to § 29-2-116.True v.

   Because a lien foreclosure action by a subcontractor was an in rem action against the owner and did not require the presence of either the bankrupt contractor or its alleged joint venturer, Wyo. R. Civ. P. 19 and this section did not preclude the district court from granting summary judgment to the subcontractor in their absence; moreover, the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C.S. § 362(a) did not apply to the proceedings against the solvent owner.

   A contractor is not an indispensable party to a lien foreclosure unless the owner of the property subject to lien wants him joined. Since the employees of a contractor who filed for bankruptcy untimely filed their suit for foreclosure of a mechanic's lien, and since the contractor was not an indispensable party, the automatic stay granted the contractor by federal law did not stay foreclosure against the owner under either state or federal law, and the employees had no lien at the time of filing their action.

   Where a corporate debtor-landowner was an indispensable party to a foreclosure action against nondebtor mortgage holders, an architect's amended petition to foreclose his lien was subject to the automatic stay of the federal Bankruptcy Code, and this section was tolled during the pendency of the debtor's bankruptcy proceedings.

     <p>
      
   A contractor is not an indispensable party to a lien foreclosure unless the owner of the property subject to lien wants him joined. Since the employees of a contractor who filed for bankruptcy untimely filed their suit for foreclosure of a mechanic's lien, and since the contractor was not an indispensable party, the automatic stay granted the contractor by federal law did not stay foreclosure against the owner under either state or federal law, and the employees had no lien at the time of filing their action.

   No action was brought within 180 days after the filing of the lien statement to foreclose the interest of the mortgage interest holder, and thus the lien could not affect its interest. The fact that a suit was commenced within 180 days against the owners of the property, to whom the statute of limitations defense was not available, was irrelevant. Seafirst Mortgage Corp. v.

   Where the mortgagee made no effort of any kind whatever to take possession or control of oil produced on a leasehold, or the proceeds thereof, up to the time when plaintiff's lien for labor and material furnished under a contract with the assignee of an oil and gas lease became effective, the lien of the plaintiff must be held to be prior and superior to the claim of the mortgagee insofar as the oil and the proceeds thereof are concerned.

      Because a lien on production did not relate back to the time prior to the petition date under Wyoming law, a creditor’s postpetition actions did not fall within the scope and safeguards of the relation back exception; rather, these actions violated the automatic stay, as they would give rise to postpetition liens and cause interception of debtor receivables.

      Judgment was entered for a creditor on a trustee's claim under 11 U.S.C.S. § 544 to avoid the creditor's liens on oil and gas properties as unperfected because the trustee was bound by a judgment on the creditor's action to foreclose on the liens, which contained a finding that the creditor's liens were valid, and the creditor provided requisite notice of its asserted liens in the crude production proceeds under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 29-3-105(b).

       A lien claimant may retain possession of the property to which the lien pertains until paid for the labor, services, materials and feed which entitle the lien claimant to assert the lien.
