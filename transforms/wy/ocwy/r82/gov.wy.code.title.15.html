     Revision of title. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    
   Laws 1980, ch. 38, § 1, revised this title, amending and renumbering <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t15c01a01s15-1-101" target="_self">§§ 15-1-101</a></cite> to 15-11-18 as 15-1-101 to 15-10-117. No detailed explanation of the changes made by the 1980 Act have been attempted, but, where appropriate, historical citations to former provisions have been added to corresponding sections in this title, and annotations from cases decided under former provisions have been placed under comparable sections in this title where it was felt they would be helpful. For tables of revised and renumbered sections, see Volume 11 of the Wyoming Statutes Annotated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Laws 1980, ch. 38, § 2, reads: “Any other act adopted by the Wyoming legislature during the same session in which this act is adopted shall be given precedence and shall prevail over the amendments in this act to the extent that such acts are in conflict.” Section 3, ch. 38, Laws 1980, makes the act effective on January 1, 1981.

   Under modern conditions there is a tendency to revert to the common-law rule of liability as to the damage done by wandering livestock, and this would be appropriately applied to a city passing an ordinance pursuant to subsection 16 of former § 15-686, W.S. 1957 (similar to subsection (a)(xiv) of this section), which would prohibit cattle from wandering at large in city limits.

       All contracts for any type of public improvement, excluding contracts for professional services or where the primary purpose is emergency work or maintenance, for any city or town or joint powers board wherein at least one (1) member is a municipality shall be advertised for bid or for response if a request for proposal or qualification for construction manager agent, construction manager at risk or design-builder is used, if the estimated cost, including all related costs, exceeds a bid threshold of thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00), except that a contract for the purchase or lease of a new automobile or truck shall be advertised regardless of cost and if there is an automobile or truck for trade-in, it shall be included as a part of the advertisement and bid. The requirements of W.S. 15-1-112(a) do not apply to any city or town trading in an automobile or truck on the purchase of a new automobile or truck.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01a01s15-1-113ol1b">
       The advertisement shall be published on two (2) different occasions, at least seven (7) days apart, in a newspaper having general circulation in the city or town, or if a joint powers board in any city or town which is a member of the board. The published notice shall state the place, date and time when the bids or proposals will be received and bids will be publicly opened and the place where interested persons may obtain complete specifications of work to be performed.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01a01s15-1-113ol1c">
       If the contract is let for bid, the contract shall be let to the lowest bidder who shall be determined qualified and responsible in the sole discretion of the governing body. The governing body may use alternate design and construction delivery methods as defined under W.S. 16-6-701 if deemed appropriate. The governing body may reject all bids or responses submitted if it finds that none of them would serve the public interest. For contracts in excess of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00), cities, towns and joint powers boards may prequalify contractors who wish to submit bids or responses based on such criteria as the project type and experience, expertise, professional qualifications, past performance, staff proposed, schedule proposed, financial strength, qualification of supervisors proposed to be used, technical solutions proposed or references.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c01a01s15-1-113ol1d">
       Every contract shall be executed by the mayor or in his absence or disability, by the president or other presiding officer of the governing body and by the clerk or designee of the governing body. The successful bidder or respondent shall furnish to the city, town or joint powers board a bond or other form of guarantee in accordance with W.S. 16-6-112.

       Before advertising for a bid for any work on the construction of any public improvements and except as provided under W.S. 16-6-707 for alternate design and construction delivery methods, detailed plans and specifications shall be prepared, together with an estimate of the probable cost and a form of the proposed contract. A city, town or joint powers board may withhold a percentage of the calculated value of any work completed as retainage in accordance with W.S. 16-6-702(b). No progress payment may be made until the city or town engineer or designated local official has furnished the estimate, together with a certificate that the amount of work estimated to have been done conforms in all material respects with the requirements of the contract. A joint powers board may designate an official of any member city or town to perform the functions required by this subsection.

       In advertising for any bid, the forms of guarantee required under this section and approved by the city, town or joint powers board shall be specified. In addition, bidders shall be required to accompany each bid with a bid bond or if the bid is one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00) or less, any other form of bid guarantee approved by the city, town or joint powers board, equal to at least five percent (5%) of the total bid amount, with sufficient surety and payable to the city, town or joint powers board. The bid guarantee shall be forfeited as liquidated damages if the bidder, upon the letting of the contract to him, fails to enter into the contract within thirty (30) days after it is presented to him for that purpose or fails to proceed with the performance of the contract. The bid guarantee shall be retained by the city, town or joint powers board until proper bond or other form of security satisfactory to the city, town or joint powers board to secure performance of the contract has been filed and approved. The right to reject any bid is reserved in all bid advertisements. All bids shall be numbered consecutively before they are opened and no further bids may be received after the advertised time of opening bids and any bid is publicly opened. The city, town or joint powers board shall give all persons who desire an opportunity to inspect all bids when they are opened. No bid may be considered unless accompanied by a bid guarantee in the required amount.

Assignment by any other means renders the contract null and void as to any further performance by the contractor or the assignee, without any act on the part of the city, town or joint powers board. The city, town or joint powers board may at once proceed to relet the contract or may at its discretion proceed to complete the contract as agent at the expense of the contractor and his sureties.

   While the city board of public utilities by statute must accept the lowest responsible bid, any material departure from the bid specifications invalidates a bid, and the defaulting party cannot be classed as a bidder.

   A minor technical defect or irregularity which does not affect the substance of the bid does not justify the rejection of the lowest bid. Centric Corp. v. Barbarossa &amp; Sons, 521 P.2d 874, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 200</cite> (Wyo. 1974).

     <p>
      

    One consideration given to determination whether departure from bid specifications is material
    

   is whether or not a variation would give a bidder an advantage or benefit not allowed to other bidders so as to destroy the competitive character of the bidding process. Centric Corp. v. Barbarossa &amp; Sons, 521 P.2d 874, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 200</cite> (Wyo. 1974).

    Omission of material to be filed with a bid was minor
    

   and inconsequential so as not to affect the substance of the bid justifying its rejection by the city board of public utilities. Centric Corp. v. Barbarossa &amp; Sons, 521 P.2d 874, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 200</cite> (Wyo. 1974).

   Although a court concludes that an omission with a bid was minor and inconsequential, it cannot require that the city board of public utilities must accept the bid. All the court can require is that the board cannot reject the bid on the basis of the omission where the bid submitted is the lowest. Centric Corp. v.

     <p>
      
   A construction company that had submitted a bid to a city for the construction of a fire station was not entitled to rescind its bid without penalty because of a mistake in computing the amount of the bid. However, pursuant to an agreement made in the course of a declaratory judgment action, the city stated they would abide by the decision of the district court with respect to the company's right to rescind. When the district court ruled the company was entitled to rescind its bid, this ruling, though erroneous, was upheld, because of a strong public policy in favor of settlement of litigation.

   This section prescribes the procedure to be followed in a proceeding initiated by landowners of an area proposed to be annexed.

A third method prescribed by <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t15c01a04s15-1-407" target="_self">§ 15-1-407</a></cite>, insofar as landowners are concerned, permits annexation without the necessity of a resolution or public hearing in the event the owner or owners of all of the area sought to be annexed petition the city or town to annex such area.

   Section 15-1-407 provides for an annexation method that does not require identifying “landowners” or applying the petition compliance procedures found in this section, but forgoes those procedures and chooses instead to solely rely upon the requirement that the ordinance provide a statement that all owners of the territory have signed a petition requesting annexation; an annexation ordinance that fails to comply with this requirement would be subject to district court review and could be declared void under <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t15c01a04s15-1-409ol1b" target="_self">§ 15-1-409(b)</a></cite>.

     </p>
     <p>
      
   The broad powers delegated by the legislature can fairly encompass the power to adopt a park-land dedication ordinance. A city can require the payment of a sum in lieu of park-land dedication in order to lessen the impact and pressure on park facilities that results from the influx of inhabitants caused by a new development. The limitation on this power is the requirement that any fees collected in lieu of land dedication must be earmarked to accounts for the purpose of acquiring needed park land and maintenance of existing park facilities.

The map may also show the location of the lines of streets on plats of subdivisions which the commission has approved.

Before taking any such action the governing body shall hold a public hearing thereon.

      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      
   The broad powers delegated by the legislature can fairly encompass the power to adopt a park-land dedication ordinance. A city can require the payment of a sum in lieu of park-land dedication in order to lessen the impact and pressure on park facilities that results from the influx of inhabitants caused by a new development. The limitation on this power is the requirement that any fees collected in lieu of land dedication must be earmarked to accounts for the purpose of acquiring needed park land and maintenance of existing park facilities.

    Use restrictions must be justified under some aspect of police power
    

   exerted for the public welfare. Unless the particular regulation bears a substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience or the general good and welfare in the proper sense, it is an invasion of the constitutional right of private property. The inquiry in such case is whether the restraint thus put upon property passes the bounds of reason and assumes the character of a merely arbitrary fiat. State ex rel. George v. Hull, 65 Wyo. 251, 199 P.2d 832, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

   Statutory authority permitting zoning in incorporated cities and towns of state is the police power of the state thus delegated, but such authority, relative to a residence district, which is to preserve rather than to disrupt existing conditions, must be reasonably exercised, which was not done when it deprived plaintiff of beneficial use of his property, amid surrounding business properties, of which defendant city had sufficient notice; hence enforcement of ordinance zoning for residence purposes only would be enjoined.

   Only reasonable interpretation of a town's zoning ordinances was that all the choices under a parking option remained available to a brewery as non-conforming use; it would have violated paragraph (d)(iv) to declare that the parking options were no longer available to the brewery, as such a result would have rendered valueless the brewery's substantial business investment.

    Provisions cannot be compared with the Wyoming community development provisions,
   
   § 9-7-101 et seq., because, under this article, it is absolutely clear that only the revenues of the project are responsible for payment of the revenue bonds and the tax revenues and the taxing powers of the city are not under any circumstances subjected to appropriation to satisfy the indebtedness. This article does not have the same tax implications and manipulations of public tax money which are found so openly referred to and relied upon to back up and pay off the proposed bonds as in the Wyoming Community Development Act.

   In order to determine that a project helps to maintain and promote “a stable, balanced and diversified economy,” as called for by subparagraph (a)(i)(C), there must be evidence concerning the area's current economic base. Evidence must be presented relating to the area's economic sectors of agriculture or natural resource development. Without such evidence, the governing body's actions must be set aside as an abuse of discretion. Holding's Little Am. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 712 P.2d 331, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo.

       Any municipality or county may refund at any time any bonds issued under this article and outstanding, including without limitation short-term bonds issued in anticipation of the issuance of long-term bonds, by issuing refunding bonds in an amount sufficient to refund the principal together with any unpaid interest and any necessary premiums and commissions. An issue of refunding bonds may be combined with an issue of additional revenue bonds on any project if consistent with the requirements of W.S. 15-1-705. Any refunding may be effected whether the bonds to be refunded have matured or shall thereafter mature, either by sale of the refunding bonds and the application of the proceeds in payment of the bonds to be refunded, or by exchange of the refunding bonds for the bonds to be refunded. The holders of any bonds to be refunded are not compelled without their consent to surrender their bonds for payment or exchange prior to the date on which they are by their terms subject to redemption by option or otherwise. Any refunding bonds are subject to the provisions of W.S. 15-1-703 and may be secured as provided in W.S. 15-1-704. The principal proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows:

Money in any trust fund may be invested in direct obligations of or obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government or obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government.

The municipality or county may authorize the user of the project, or an agent of the user or a trustee, to disburse the proceeds of the revenue bonds to pay only those costs of the project specified in W.S. 15-1-707 and only upon the conditions that the user agrees to complete the acquisition or construction of the project and pay to the municipality or county an amount sufficient to pay, when due, the principal, interest and premium, if any, on the revenue bonds, and any other expenses incurred by the municipality or county in connection therewith. The revenue bonds are payable solely from the revenues derived from payments to the municipality or county by the user of the project.

      The mayor is entitled to sign or veto any ordinance passed by the governing body and to sign or veto any order, bylaw, resolution, award or vote to enter into any contract or the allowance of any claim. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the qualified members of the council. If the mayor neglects or refuses to sign any ordinance and fails to return it with his objections in writing at the next regular meeting of the governing body, it becomes law without his signature. The mayor may veto any item of any appropriation ordinance and approve the remainder thereof. The items vetoed may be passed over the veto as in other cases. The mayor does not have a vote in any matter involving the override of a veto.

   Construction company seeking damages for breach of contract complied with the service requirements of Wyo. Const. art. 16, 7 when it served its notice of claim on the town's mayor, administrator, attorney, and project engineer. The construction company was not required to serve the notice of claim on the town treasurer under this section.

   Language of this section cannot be stretched to find even an obligation for a town treasurer to perform an auditing function, let alone to find an interpretation that makes a town treasurer the sole town official upon whom a governmental claim may be served. It imposes only obligations with respect to how a town's accounts must be maintained, their availability for inspection and a town treasurer's reporting frequency.

     <p>
      The mayor is entitled to sign or veto any ordinance passed by the governing body and to sign or veto any order, bylaw, resolution, award or vote to enter into any contract, or the allowance of any claim. A veto may be overridden by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of all the qualified members of the council. If the mayor neglects or refuses to sign any ordinance and fails to return it with his objections in writing at the next regular meeting of the governing body, it becomes law without his signature. The mayor may veto any item of any appropriation ordinance and approve the remainder thereof. The items vetoed may be passed over the veto as in other cases. The mayor does not have a vote in any matter involving the override of a veto.

   Where mayor, before annexation of territory by city, was informed, by legal owner of part thereof, of sale of some of it specifically for business purposes, and after annexation but before its zoning for residence purposes, council was notified of existence of such equity by purchaser, and, after zoning ordinance for residence purposes only was passed, such purchaser applied for and was successively denied permit for business purposes, notice was sufficient to protect his equity, though contract was not of record and plat in annexation proceedings mentioned no restrictions.

The petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds for removal. The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one (1) paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence, giving the street and number. One (1) of the signers of each paper shall make oath before a competent officer that the statements therein made are true as he believes, and that each signature is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. Within ten (10) days from the date of filing the petition the clerk shall determine whether or not the petition is signed by the requisite number of qualified electors. If necessary, the commission shall allow him extra help for that purpose. The clerk shall attach to the petition his certificate, showing the result of his examination. If the petition is insufficient, it shall be returned to the person who filed it, without prejudice to the filing of a new petition to the same effect. If the petition is sufficient, the clerk shall submit it to the governing body without delay. The governing body shall then fix a date for holding the election, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than forty (40) days from the date of the clerk’s certificate of sufficiency.

On the second Tuesday preceding the date fixed for the special election, a special primary election for the selection of candidates shall be held. The special primary election and nomination are governed by the provisions of this article. If the person sought to be removed is a candidate, one (1) opposing candidate shall be selected at the special primary election. The special primary election shall be held if there are more than two (2) nominees, one (1) of whom may be incumbent. If there are no candidates nominated against the officer sought to be removed, no special election will be held and the incumbent shall continue in office.

       In any removal election the candidate receiving the highest number of votes is elected.

If the person who receives the highest number of votes fails to qualify within ten (10) days after receiving notification of election the office is vacant. This method of removal is in addition to any other methods provided by law.

       The governing body, as soon as possible after the first election, shall employ a city manager and a city attorney and fix their salaries. The city manager shall receive no other or additional salary for the performance of any of the duties required of him as city manager. The city manager is an employee and serves at the pleasure of the governing body. His salary may be changed from year to year, and his employment may be terminated at any time by a majority vote of the governing body.

If the position is vacant for any reason, the governing body shall immediately proceed to employ another person. If there is a delay in securing a new manager, the governing body shall immediately appoint an acting manager to fill the vacancy on an interim basis. He shall qualify the same as the manager and shall be vested with authority and charged with the duties and responsibilities of the manager until a manager is employed and qualified.

The city attorney is not required to perform any service other than legal service. In cities and towns having a population of more than ten thousand (10,000), policemen and firemen are not required to perform any service other than that normally considered to be within their departments.

      The manager shall enforce all statutes, ordinances and regulations relative to the public health, comfort and safety. If the owner or occupant of property deposits or allows the accumulation of garbage, offal, manure or rubbish of any kind upon it, or in the streets or alleys upon which it abuts, or permits weeds to grow and remain on the property, in violation of any statute or ordinance, the manager shall serve notice upon the occupant, or the owner or his agent, to remove the rubbish or weeds. If they are not removed within one (1) day after service of notice, the manager shall have them removed. The cost of removal shall be assessed against the property and constitutes a lien thereon. The owner shall be notified of the amount assessed, and if it is not paid, it shall be collected in the same manner as other special assessments.

All sidewalks and curbs shall be constructed as designated by the manager. However, the manager shall not require any person to construct a walk or curb in a different manner, or of a different material, than is required of other persons in the same block fronting the street. It is the duty of landowners to keep any sidewalk or curb now constructed, or which may hereafter be constructed in front of the land, in good repair and in safe condition.

The notice shall be served personally upon the owner, or if he is not to be found within the city or town, it shall be sent to him by registered or certified mail, requesting a return receipt, if his address is known. Otherwise it shall be published once in the official newspaper of the city or town. Unless the owner within two (2) weeks after service, mailing or publication of the notice, begins the construction or repair and completes it without delay, the manager shall have the work done at the expense of the permanent improvement revolving fund. Upon completion of the work, the manager shall certify the cost thereof to the clerk of the city or town. The governing body shall then fix a date for hearing upon the costs. The procedure for notice and hearing shall be as set forth in W.S. 15-6-405. Upon confirmation of the assessment by the governing body, the charge levied is a lien upon the property as set forth in W.S. 15-6-406. The governing body may levy and collect the assessment and provide for the manner of sale, redemption and conveyance of lands sold for nonpayment of the assessment in the manner provided in W.S. 15-6-401 through 15-6-448. When collected the assessment shall be paid into the revolving fund. The manager, upon proper showing made to him, may extend the time within which the construction or repair shall begin or be completed.

Any city or town may pay a salary in excess of five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) per month.

     <p>
      
   Whatever rights a city fireman who reached mandatory retirement age of 65 without having completed the number of years of service for a full pension had under the pension plan, such rights did not go so far as to deny the legislature the right to regulate the terms of the employment and by a nondiscriminatory enactment to place a time limit upon the right to continued employment.

        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1ai">
         The paid firemen’s pension plan was established in 1935 and restructured in 1981. In 1981 with the restructuring of the paid firemen’s pension plan, the original firemen’s pension plan became known as “paid firemen plan A” or “Fire A”. The legislature contributed approximately forty-six million eight hundred thousand dollars ($46,800,000.00) between 1981 and 1996 to make up the accumulated underfunding of Fire A from inception to the point of restructuring;
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1aii">
         Statute has directed since the inception of the paid firemen’s pension plan and as provided in W.S. 15-5-202 that the firemen’s pension account shall be administered without liability on the part of the state beyond the amount of the fund;
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1aiii">
         Upon recommendation from the Wyoming retirement system and consulting actuaries, the legislature adopted an act ceasing contributions to Fire A as of April 1, 1997. This included the previously required contributions of eight percent (8%) of salary, employer contributions of twenty-one percent (21%) of salary and contributions of fifty percent (50%) of the fire insurance premium tax collected by the state each year;
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1aiv">
         Had employers and employees made contributions between April 1, 1997 and December 31, 2020 the estimated contributions would be worth approximately thirty-three million dollars ($33,000,000.00) as of December 31, 2020, using a seven percent (7%) annual rate of return;
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1av">
         Upon the recommendation of the Wyoming retirement system and consulting actuaries, the legislature repeatedly increased benefits for Fire A members and retirees. Increases included an increase of the percentage of salary used to calculate benefits, the removal of a cap on benefits and the increase of benefits for surviving spouses from thirty-three and one-third percent (33 1/3%) up to one hundred percent (100%);
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1avi">
         Despite an actuarial report dated January 1, 2002 noting a deteriorated funded position of Fire A, employee and employer contributions were not reinstituted;
        </li>
        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1avii">
         The Wyoming retirement system reports that the Fire A retiree pension payroll was nine million three hundred thousand dollars ($9,300,000.00) in 2002 and is estimated to be sixteen million three hundred thousand dollars ($16,300,000.00) in 2021. This increase is primarily due to the statutory three percent (3%) annual compounded cost-of-living adjustment that has been in effect since 2004;

        <li id="t15c05a02s15-5-211ol1aviii">

At the hearing or hearings, the governing body will consider the objections or any part thereof, and correct, revise, raise, lower, change or modify the roll or any part thereof, or set it aside and order that the roll assessments be made de novo, in a manner appearing just and equitable, and then proceed to confirm the roll by ordinance.

In the absence of fraud the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceedings under this chapter. Any list of names or addresses pertaining to any district may be revised from time to time, but it need not be revised more frequently than at twelve (12) month intervals.

       Assessments; foreclosure action for delinquency.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any city or town may proceed with the collection or enforcement of any delinquent assessment or delinquent installment in an action brought in its own name in the district court in the county in which the city or town is located. It is not necessary to bring a separate suit for each piece or parcel of property delinquent, but all or any part of the property delinquent under any single assessment roll or assessment district may be proceeded against in the same action. Any of the owners or persons interested in any of the property may be joined as parties defendant in the action to foreclose, and any liens for delinquent assessments or installments may be foreclosed in the proceeding. The proceeding shall be tried before the court without a jury. In any such proceeding, it is sufficient to allege the passage of the ordinance providing for the improvement, the making of the improvement, the levying of the improvement assessment, the confirmation thereof, the date of delinquency of the assessment or installment and that the assessment was not paid prior to the delinquency or at all. The assessment roll and confirmatory order or authenticated copies are prima facie evidence of the regularity and legality of the proceedings connected therewith, and the burden of proof is upon the defendants. In any action where the owners or parties interested in any particular lot, tract or parcel of land or other property included in the suit suffer a default, the court may enter judgment of foreclosure and sale as to those parties and property and order execution thereon, and the action may proceed as to the remaining defendants and property. The judgment of the court shall specify separately the amount of the assessment or installment, with interest, penalty and costs, chargeable to the several lots, tracts and parcels of land and other property in the proceedings. The judgment has the effect of a separate judgment, and any appeal shall not invalidate or delay it except as to the property which is the subject of the appeal. In entering judgment the court shall decree that such lots, tracts or parcels of land or other property be sold to enforce the judgment and execution shall issue for the enforcement of the decree. Judgment may be entered as to any one (1) or more lots, tracts or parcels of land or other property involved, and the court may retain jurisdiction of the case as to the balance. All proceedings supplemental to judgment, including appeal, order of sale, period of redemption, sale and the issuance of deed shall be conducted in accordance with the law relating to property sold upon foreclosure of real estate mortgages.

However, the assessment shall not exceed the actual cost and expense of the improvement, together with the accrued interest thereon, and the cost of the reassessment. It is the intent of this chapter to make the cost and expense of local improvements payable by the property specially benefited thereby, notwithstanding that the proceedings of the governing body, board of public works or other board, officers or authority of the city or town may be found irregular or defective, whether jurisdictional or otherwise.

      The city or town shall withdraw annually from the revolving fund and deposit in the local improvement district fund sufficient money to meet the difference between the principal amount of assessments due that year and the amount of assessments actually collected that year. Delinquent assessments shall remain liens upon the property assessed, and if they are enforced or foreclosed, the proceeds of the sales or other payments discharging the delinquencies shall revert to the revolving fund in repayment of the amounts advanced. If there is money in the local improvement fund which is not required for the payment of any bond or interest of the local improvement fund, and after all bonds and interest have been fully paid, the money remaining in the local improvement fund, by order of the governing body, shall be transferred to the revolving fund for disposition as the governing body may determine.

      The owner of any lot, tract or parcel of land or other property charged with any assessments may redeem it from all or any portion of the liability for the contract price of the improvement by paying the entire assessment or any portion thereof charged against the lot or parcel of land, without interest, within thirty (30) days after notice to him of the assessment unless the legal owners of record of all of the property assessed in the district have waived this thirty (30) day period. Unless the legal owners of record of all property assessed in the district waive the thirty (30) day cash payment period, the city or town treasurer, as soon as the assessment roll has been placed in his hands for collection, shall publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town. The notice shall be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks and shall specify that the roll is in his hands for collection and that any assessment thereon or any portion of any assessment may be paid at any time within thirty (30) days from the date of the first publication of the notice without penalty, interest or costs. Bonds may be issued prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period but only if the legal owners of all of the property assessed in the district have waived the thirty (30) day cash payment period, and bonds may be issued at any time after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period. The governing body may provide that the owner of any lot or parcel of land may redeem it from all liability for the unpaid amount of the assessment at any time after the thirty (30) days, if applicable, by paying all the installments of the assessment remaining unpaid, with interest thereon to the date of the maturity of the installment next falling due. If any sum is paid as provided in this section, it shall be paid to the city treasurer, or to the officer whose duty it is to collect the assessments, and all sums so paid shall be applied solely to the payment of the cost and expense of the improvements or to the redemption of the bonds issued.

Any owner of any lot or parcel of land or property to be assessed for the cost of construction of the sidewalks then ordered or proposed to be ordered to be constructed may appear in person or by counsel at the hearing and show cause, if any, why the sidewalks should not be constructed.

The ordinance shall provide that upon ordering the construction of any such sidewalk the city engineer or the street commissioner shall immediately give written notice thereof, served personally on the owner or owners, or agents of the abutting property, or by publication once a week for a period of four (4) weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the city or town, fully describing the termini, course, width and character of the walk ordered. The notice shall provide for a period of thirty (30) days during which parties so desiring may construct the walk abutting their property, and that all the walks so ordered remaining unbuilt at the expiration of the thirty (30) days from the date of service, or of the first publication, shall be constructed by the contractor. The ordinance shall also provide that at the expiration of the thirty (30) days the city engineer or the street commissioner shall notify the contractor to build the portions of the sidewalk ordered that have not been built. The contractor shall construct the sidewalk in accordance with the ordinance and his contract within sixty (60) days after he is so notified.

   Mayor and city council were authorized to make city's bonds and interest coupons payable in such place as they saw fit, and to indicate by ordinance to that effect. Failure of council in its contract with its fiscal agent in New York to demand security relieved city treasurer from duty of making such demand and he was justified in transmitting moneys to such agent to pay bonds and coupons without liability for loss sustained by the failure of such agent.

   This section, authorizing the issuance of airport bonds by cities and towns in an amount not exceeding four percent of the assessed valuation of such city or town, was construed by the supreme court to permit issuance of bonds to the extent of two percent in order to preserve the constitutionality of the section in view of art. 16, § 5, Wyo. Const., which prior to 1962 imposed a two percent limitation on cities, towns and villages, with certain exceptions. Hanson v. Greybull, 63 Wyo. 467, 183 P.2d 393, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 21</cite> (Wyo. 1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      
   The words appearing in the first sentence of this section, and reading, “not exceeding, at one (1) time,” might be misleading and seem to authorize the creation of indebtedness of the stated percentage for other times regardless of the fact that the statutory percentage limit has been attained. But to so read the statute would be to disregard the elementary principle that it will not be presumed that the legislature intended to enact a law in violation of constitutional restrictions. The words “at one (1) time” could very well have been omitted. Hanson v. Greybull, 63 Wyo. 467, 183 P.2d 393, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 21</cite> (Wyo. 1947).

      Any city or town owning its municipal water system or plant may enter into agreements with the owners of lands who desire to have the water system extended to their property within the corporate limits of the city or town. The land owners shall agree to pay to the city or town a stipulated amount, in installments as may be agreed upon, for a period not to exceed ten (10) years, regardless of the use or nonuse of water during the period, and to making the charges a lien upon their respective lands. When the agreement has been filed with the city or town clerk, the charges become a lien upon the lands. Any city or town, by ordinance, may prescribe the rules and regulations governing the agreements and provide for the enforcement of the lien.

       All cities and towns owning their municipal water system or plant may enter into agreements with customers whose lands lie outside the corporate limits to supply water for their use and needs. The water system may be extended and maintained beyond the corporate limits only if it is economically feasible in the opinion of the governing body. The governing body may finance the extension and maintenance of the water system through revenue bonds or other means granted by law for financing of its water system and improvements. A one-time connection fee reasonably calculated to permit recovery of a proportionate share of the municipality’s infrastructure cost necessary to treat and convey the water may be charged. A one-time fee may also be charged to recover reasonable expenses incurred by the public entity in determining the actual costs of treating and delivering water to the point of connection. Any charges for special services such as customer’s line maintenance shall be in addition to the water rate. The rate established for use of water pursuant to this section is as follows:

Prior to December 1, 1998, or where the city or town is not a recipient of state grants or loans and except as otherwise provided in W.S. 15-7-407, the established rate shall be applied uniformly and shall not exceed two (2) times the established rate within the corporate limits. The governing body of the city or town may establish one (1) or more unincorporated service areas in each of which an average water rate may be used for all customers. As used in this paragraph, “actual costs of providing and delivering water” shall include a proportionate share of the following costs related to the water system:

The schedule of prices when fixed is not subject to revision more often than once every two (2) years without the permission of the corporation. The governing body has full authority to collect all water rents and charges due from consumers.

In lieu of taxes on property exempt under this section, a municipality or county may agree to make such payments to any public body as it finds consistent with the maintenance of the low-rent character of housing projects and the achievement of the purpose of this chapter.

The provisions of this section do not apply to or limit the right of obligees to pursue any remedies for the enforcement of any pledge or lien given by the municipality or county on its rents, fees or revenues or the right of the federal government to pursue any remedies conferred upon it pursuant to this chapter. A municipality or county may waive its exemption under this section with respect to claims against any profitmaking enterprise occupying any portion of a project, provided that a waiver does not affect or impair the rights of any obligee of the municipality or county.

   If the combined effect of subsections (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) is to give a new form of government much more than four years to operate before a different form of government can be instituted because of the timing of elections, that is a decision made by the legislature, and it is not for the courts to determine otherwise; said paragraphs do not conflict.

    Question of submitting to electors of a Wyoming city proposition of accepting manager form of government
    

   in that city is not controlled directly by the Wyoming constitution nor are the provisions relating thereto specifically designated as initiative and referendum. However, in many states similar provisions are constitutional and are so denominated. State ex rel. Benham v. Cheever, 71 Wyo. 303, 257 P.2d 337, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1953).
     </p>
     <p>
      

    It is sufficient if petition is signed by qualified electors.
    

   There is no constitutional provision which prohibits the legislature from permitting the signing of the petition by persons not yet registered but who upon registration would be permitted to vote. State ex rel. Keefe v. McInerney, 63 Wyo. 280, 182 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      

    But it is undoubtedly required and contemplated that signers of petition should at least be residents of city in good faith.
    

   It is hardly probable, however, that it is contemplated that all signers of the petition should be compelled to go on the witness stand to testify to their own qualifications as signers of the petition. That means that resort must be had to secondary and less satisfactory evidence to prove that the requisite number of qualified electors have signed the petition. State ex rel. Keefe v. McInerney, 63 Wyo. 280, 182 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1947).

       Prima facie evidence of sufficiency of petitions. —

     </p>
     <p>
      
   In a mandamus proceeding by petitioners to compel the mayor of Cheyenne to call an election for determination by the people whether the city should adopt a city manager plan, papers denominated “Petition for manager form of government” filed with the city of Cheyenne, which were introduced into evidence without objection, constituted prima facie evidence sufficient to show that these “petitions” were what they purported to be. Thereafter, it became incumbent upon the city authorities to present evidence to the court questioning the validity and correctness of the petitions, if such officials doubted their propriety and correctness. State ex rel. Benham v. Cheever, 71 Wyo. 303, 257 P.2d 337, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1953).
