      State's newly enacted residency requirement for the position of assistant adjutant general (AAG) of the Wyoming national guard violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and consequently, removal of two officers from their positions as AAGs violated the United States Constitution; the proper remedy was reinstatement.

   The veteran's preference contained in subsection (a) does not extend to a qualified veteran seeking a transfer to another state agency. The legislature intended for this section to give qualified veterans the benefit of a competitive advantage in the state hiring process. Giving a preference to veterans who are pursuing a transfer or promotion within the state government in no way advances this legislative process. Pinther v.

If the study results indicate the need for establishment of a veterans' nursing home, the commission is to develop a master plan for the proposed facility, which considers potential funding sources for a state veterans' home, alternatives to construction of a new facility and potential sites for a state veterans' home. The commission is to report its written findings and recommendations to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee and the joint appropriations interim committee on or before October 1, 2005.
