       The state department of health is hereby empowered and directed to make such rules and regulations as shall in its judgment be necessary for the carrying out of the provisions of this act, including rules and regulations providing for the control and treatment of persons isolated or quarantined under the provisions of W.S. 35-4-133 and 35-4-134, and such other rules and regulations not in conflict with provisions of this act concerning the control of venereal diseases and concerning the care, treatment and quarantine of persons infected therewith as it may from time to time deem advisable. All such regulations so made shall be of force and binding upon all county and municipal health officers and other persons affected by this act and shall have the force and effect of law; provided, further, that the expense incident to the quarantine and treatment of venereally infected persons in prisons shall be borne by the county in which the person or persons are imprisoned, excepting inmates of state institutions which shall be borne by the state, when evidenced by proper vouchers and receipts approved by the department of health.

       The department of health may promulgate rules and regulations to set standards for the chemical, bacteriological, physical or radiological content of a small water supply and shall be applicable only when a legal interest in real property to which the small water supply is appurtenant is conveyed from one (1) party to another or when a conveyance is reasonably anticipated and when such standards are required by a lender. As used in this subsection, “small water supply” means any water supply with not more than nine (9) service connections, which is currently used for human consumption or for which plans exist for its future use for human consumption. The cost of any testing to determine the chemical, bacteriological, physical or radiological content of a small water supply shall be borne by the parties.

   Adoption statutes did not preclude the district court from ordering a Wyoming adoption decree recognizing or approving a Hague Convention adoption certificate. Reading the broad language of Wyo. Stat. Ann. <cite class="ocak"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c22a01s1-22-111" target="_blank">§ 1-22-111</a></cite>, with the express statutory language of Wyo. Stat. Ann. <cite class="ocak"><a href="#t35c01a04s35-1-417ol1e" target="_self">§ 35-1-417(e)</a></cite>, the adoption statutes allowed district courts to approve adoptions of children born in a foreign country and to enter a report of a Wyoming adoption. As a result, the district court erred in dismissing petitioners’ petition for an order of adoption. In re Adoption of Majb, 2020 WY 157, 478 P.3d 196, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo.

   District court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a petition for an order recognizing petitioner’s change of sex and gender where it applied a presumption against district court jurisdiction, when Wyo. Const. art. 5, § 10, required a presumption in favor of jurisdiction, and Wyo. Stat.

Moreover, the legislature had expressed no clear intention to limit the district court’s jurisdiction to amend birth certificates under the Vital Records Act, and agency regulations allowing amendment of a person’s sex on her birth certificate did not modify, dilute, or change in any way the statutory provisions from which the Wyoming Department of Health derived its authority.

      Laws 2005, ch. 160, §§ 1 through 3, appropriates $ 2,500,000 from the general fund to the department of health to institute a program to pay hospitals for unreimbursed trauma care. Acute care hospitals are to be reimbursed on a per incident basis, subject to the following: (1) there is compliance with the reporting requirements of the Wyoming trauma care program registry before the request for reimbursement; (2) reimbursement is available for costs incurred after June 30, 2005 and before July 1, 2006; and (3) requests for reimbursement may be submitted to the health department for payment only after 180 days have elapsed from the date the bill for the services rendered was sent to the patient or his representative. The department is to promulgate rules and regulations to administer this program on behalf of the state of Wyoming, which are to include provisions for ensuring that reimbursements do not exceed the appropriated funds, limiting reimbursement to the necessary support of the poor, preventing duplication from this appropriation and insurance, and reimbursing hospitals for trauma service costs. The department may contract with a fiscal agent to make the actual payments and conduct any necessary audits of reimbursement requests. The department is not to reimburse any one acute care hospital in a cumulative amount greater than 25% of the amount appropriated by the act unless the department reasonably concludes, as of May 31, 2006, that the appropriation will not be fully expended, at which time the remaining funds may be used to reimburse hospitals on a pro rata basis above the 25% limit. In addition to the appropriation to carry out the purpose of the program, 50,000 is appropriated to administer the program. On or before December 1, 2005, the department of health is to report to the joint appropriations and the joint labor, health and social services interim committees on the status of the program including costs of services and how funds have been expended.

     The Wyoming legislature finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(i)
     </b>
     Physicians' medical malpractice insurance is available from a very limited number of authorized insurers in Wyoming and has been recognized to be a noncompetitive market by the Wyoming insurance commissioner;
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(ii)
     </b>
     That limited availability has been exacerbated by the withdrawal from the state of one (1) of the two (2) major medical malpractice insurers. That action will require some physicians to change insurers and some to acquire coverage for prior acts;
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(iii)
     </b>
     Medical malpractice insurance premiums generally are increasing. These premiums are even more costly if a physician is required to change insurers. The increased premiums are causing and may continue to cause physicians to limit or close their practices, or in some cases, to leave the state;
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(iv)
     </b>
     Wyoming has difficulty recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of physicians to practice in various parts of the state;
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(v)
     </b>
     A sufficient number of physicians throughout the state is critical to the availability of adequate medical care for Wyoming citizens, particularly individuals under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act and the Wyoming Uninsured Child Health Insurance Program, as well as to other needy individuals;
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(vi)
     </b>
     Ensuring the availability of adequate medical care to Wyoming citizens is a compelling interest of the state; and
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(vii)
     </b>
     The availability of adequate medical care to Wyoming citizens, is threatened without implementation of this act.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(b)
     </b>
     The legislature determines that the assistance contemplated by this act is necessary to support the compelling state interests of ensuring the availability of adequate medical care, encouraging physicians to offer medical care in Wyoming's communities, and encouraging physicians to provide medical care to needy and poor persons. The legislature further determines that assistance contemplated by this act is both for a public purpose and for necessary support of the poor as authorized in Article 16, Section 6 of the Wyoming Constitution.”

      When the assessed valuation of the property within a hospital district exceeds three million dollars ($3,000,000.00), the board of trustees for that hospital district may divide the district into no more than three (3) trustee districts and provide for the election of at least one (1) trustee from each trustee district. To become effective, the rule creating trustee districts shall be approved by order of the board of county commissioners of the county in which the greater area of property within the district is located.

   Former § 35-2-602 (confidentiality of hospital reports) could not be construed to preclude a plaintiff's access to all information which was relevant to a doctor's accreditation, in a cause of action against a hospital for negligence in the accreditation and maintenance of qualified medical personnel. The privilege protected from discovery the records concerning the internal proceedings of the hospital committee, but did not exempt from discovery materials which the committee reviewed in the course of carrying out its function, nor action which may have been taken thereafter by the hospital as may have been influenced by the committee decision. In short, privileged data did not include the materials reviewed by the committee, only those documents produced by the committee as notes, reports and findings in the review process. Greenwood v.

    A sanitary district is a civil or political subdivision of the state
    

   organized to secure, preserve and promote the public health. Such districts are necessarily located in some county, or possibly counties, in the state, and in view of the fact that some limitation of indebtedness was probably intended, they may be regarded as political subdivisions of the state as well as of the county in contemplation of the constitution, unless, of course, they constitute a city, town or village, the limitation of indebtedness of which is specifically provided.

It may approve and confirm such proceedings in part and disapprove and declare illegal or invalid other and subsequent parts of the proceedings. The court shall find and determine whether the notice of the filing of the petition has been duly given and published for the time and in the manner prescribed in W.S. 35-3-118. The costs of the special proceedings may be allowed and apportioned between the parties in the discretion of the court. If the court shall determine the proceedings for the organization of the district and for the voting and issuing of the bonds legal and valid, the board of trustees shall then prepare a written statement beginning with the filing of the petition for the organization of the district, including all subsequent proceedings for the organization of the district and voting and issuing of the bonds, and ending with the decree of the court finding the proceedings for the organization of the district and the proceedings for the voting and issuing of the bonds legal and valid, and shall present such written statement and the bonds to the director of the state department of audit. The written statement shall be certified under oath by the board of trustees of the district, and the director shall then examine the statements and the bonds so submitted to him and if he is satisfied that the bonds have been voted in conformity to law and are in all respects in due form, he shall record the statement and register the bonds in his office. No such bonds shall be issued or be valid unless they shall be so registered and have endorsed thereon a certificate of the examiner showing that such bonds are issued pursuant to law, the data filed in the office of the director being the basis of such certificate.

      The department of health shall, immediately after the receipt of information that there is any smallpox, cholera, scarlet fever, diphtheria or other infectious or contagious disease, which is a menace to the public health, in any portion of this state, order the county health officer to immediately investigate the case and report to the state health officer the results of the investigation. The state health officer shall, subject to W.S. 35-4-112 and if in his judgment the occasion requires, direct the county health officer to declare the infected place to be in quarantine. The county health officer shall place any restrictions upon ingress and egress at this location as in his judgment or in the judgment of the state health officer are necessary to prevent the spread of the disease from the infected locality. The county health officer shall upon declaring any city, town or other place to be in quarantine, control the population of the city, town or other place as in his judgment best protects the people and at the same time prevents the spread of the disease. If necessary for the protection of the public health and subject to W.S. 35-4-112, the state health officer shall establish and maintain a state quarantine and shall enforce practical regulations regarding railroads or other lines of travel into and out of the state of Wyoming as necessary for the protection of the public health. The expenses incurred in maintaining the state quarantine shall be paid out of the funds of the state treasury appropriated for this purpose and in the manner in which other expenses of the department are audited and paid. The county health officer or the department may employ a sufficient number of police officers who shall be under the control of the county health officer, to enforce and carry out any quarantine regulations the department may prescribe. The regulations shall be made public in the most practicable manner in the several counties, cities, towns or other places where the quarantine is established. If the quarantine is established by the county health officer, he shall immediately report his actions to the state health officer. The county health officer shall furnish all supplies and other resources necessary for maintaining the quarantine. Upon certificate of the county health officer approved by the director of the state department of health, the county commissioners of any county where a quarantine has been established shall issue warrants to the proper parties for the payment of all expenses, together with the expense of employing sufficient police force, to maintain and enforce the quarantine. For purposes of this act, “state health officer” means as defined in W.S. 9-2-103(e).

     <p>
      The legislature hereby finds that pesticides and devices are valuable to our state’s agricultural production and to the protection of man and the environment from insects, rodents, weeds, and other forms of life which may be pests, and it is essential to the public health and welfare that they be regulated closely to prevent adverse effects on human life and the environment. The purpose of this act [§§ 35-7-350 through 35-7-372] is to regulate, in the public interest, the labeling, distribution, storage, transportation, disposal, use and application of pesticides to control pests. New pesticides are continually being discovered or synthesized which are valuable for the control of pests, and for use as defoliants, desiccants, plant regulators, and related purposes. The dissemination of accurate scientific information as to the proper use or nonuse, of any pesticide, is vital to the public health and welfare and the environment both immediate and future. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to provide for registration of pesticides and devices.

     <p>
      The director of the department of agriculture shall administer and enforce the provisions of this act [§§ 35-7-350 through 35-7-372] and regulations issued thereunder. The board of certification may issue regulations after a public hearing following due notice to all interested persons in conformance with the provisions of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act to carry out the provisions of this act. Regulations may prescribe methods to be used in the application of pesticides, may prescribe standards for the classification and certification of applicators of pesticides, and may require certification, licensing, payment of reasonable fees for licensing or certification, submission of information, and passing of examinations by applicators of pesticides. Where the board of certification finds that regulations are necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this act, the regulations may relate to the time, place, manner, methods, materials, and amounts and concentrations, in connection with the application of the pesticide, and may restrict or prohibit use of pesticides in designated areas during specified periods of time and shall encompass all reasonable factors which the board deems necessary. The department may issue licenses. Notwithstanding the provisions of W.S. 35-7-354(e), the board of agriculture, by regulation, following a hearing and pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, may declare a specific pesticide or pesticide use a “restricted use pesticide”, but only following a recommendation of the board of certification, and a finding of fact, in a public hearing conducted by the board of certification, that unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, including man, pollinating insects, animals, crops, wildlife and lands, other than pests, may reasonably occur. The director of the department of agriculture may allow the registration, licensing, testing, inspection and reporting requirements of this article to be conducted electronically as provided by the Uniform Electronic Transaction Act, W.S. 40-21-101 through 40-21-119 and any applicable federal electronic requirements.

     <p>
      
   In a prosecution for delivery of a controlled substance, the definition of “deliver” in this section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant's conduct in handing cocaine to another at the request of a friend. Gallegos v. State, 961 P.2d 981, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo. LEXIS 122</cite> (Wyo. 1998).
     </p>
     <p>
      
   Where police officers responded to a report that the odor of burning marijuana was emanating from an apartment where minors were present, defendant retrieved from her bedroom a wooden box containing a small amount of marijuana and other paraphernalia. The corporal testified that three juveniles admitted that they had smoked marijuana and defendant admitted that she supplied the drugs; the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for three felony counts of delivery of a controlled substance to a minor in violation of this section.
   
   Anderson v. State, 2009 WY 119, 216 P.3d 1143, <cite class="wy_code">2009 Wyo. LEXIS 130</cite> (Wyo. 2009).
     </p>
     <p>
      

    Defendant constructively delivered controlled substance
    

   where defendant set up the transaction, he asked the informant how much she wanted, he told her to accompany him to the back bedroom, and he brought out the methamphetamine which they snorted as well as the methamphetamine which the informant bought.

   In a drug case, a trooper had probable cause to seize a box from defendant's vehicle where it was emblazoned on the top with what the trooper immediately recognized as an exact replica of a marijuana leaf, and therefore, the box's incriminating character as a stash box was immediately apparent.

   In a prosecution for illegal possession of marijuana, the court's definition of “marijuana” in the jury instructions was sufficient where the evidence presented at trial showed that the baggy contained marijuana leaf and thus fell within the definition of marijuana, and counsel inferred and presented evidence that the baggy contained “seeds and stems” and later argued to the jury that it was illogical for a person to attempt to sell a “bag of seeds and stems.” Leyva v.

   Because defendant did not challenged the trial court's finding that he was competent to enter his Alford plea to felony possession of methamphetamine, any alleged error in the failure to suspend proceedings for a competency evaluation was ultimately inconsequential; defendant's motion to suspend the proceeding did not, by itself, compel the district court to suspend proceedings for a competency evaluation.

       Requirements under this section. —

     </p>
     <p>
      
   All that is required to constitute the completed crime under this section is knowledge that one is dealing with a controlled substance, coupled with a completed delivery of that contraband. Seymour v. State, 949 P.2d 881, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 156</cite> (Wyo. 1997).
     </p>
     <p>
      

    It is unlawful “to … deliver” defines general intent crime.
    

   Once a delivery takes place and the crime of delivery is charged, then the offense takes on the characteristics of a general intent crime and an instruction on specific intent is not necessary; the inference thereupon arises that the defendant intended that which resulted. Dorador v. State, 573 P.2d 839, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 257</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      

    “It is unlawful … to … possess with intent to … deliver” defines specific intent crime.
    

   When only the crime of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance is charged, and there is no physically completed delivery, the offense is a specific intent crime. Dorador v. State, 573 P.2d 839, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 257</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

   Where defendant who lived in California sold drugs to Wyoming residents in California, to be sold in Wyoming, and was convicted of conspiracy with intent to deliver methamphetamine, but the information alleged that “the conspiratorial agreement occurred in Wyoming or defendant conspired to commit an act beyond the State of Wyoming,” the failure to include an element of the offense charged in the information, that a conspiracy occurred that was intended to have had an effect in Wyoming, was a fatal variance, which a detailed affidavit could not cure.

       Elements of delivery. —

     </p>
     <p>
      
   The court rejected defendant's claim that his mind was unsullied by unlawful intent at the time he delivered what he knew to be marijuana to an undercover officer, because impurity of thought is not an element of the crime of delivery of a controlled substance under this section. Seymour v. State, 949 P.2d 881, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 156</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

   The delivery statute targets the delivery of drugs while the conspiracy statute is directed at prevention of partnerships in crime. Refusal to merge counts under the two statutes would therefore not involve a double jeopardy violation.

   Defendant was properly sentenced to 6 to 10 years on the marijuana charge and 3 to 10 years on the methamphetamine charge, to be served consecutively. In light of defendant's failure to object to the presentence investigation report which contained his prior criminal history and in light of his taped statements to police claiming to be a significant drug dealer in the area, the appellate court saw no reliance by the trial court on prosecutorial misconduct in formulating its sentencing decision.

   Where defendant had adequate opportunity to respond to information offered by the prosecutor at his sentencing hearing that was not in the presentence report, including a drug enforcement agent's testimony that defendant was a well-known local methamphetamine supplier, and where the court relied on such information in rejecting defendant's request for probation or a lesser sentence, defendant's due process rights were not violated because such evidence was reliable, and the sentence was well below the statutory maximum of 20 years set forth in Wyo.

   Even when considering the fact that a patrol car's lights remained flashing and that there were two uniformed officers present, under the totality of the circumstances, a defendant's consent to a second round of questions and subsequent dog sniff search was voluntary because the initial traffic stop was brief, the trooper's conduct was professional, courteous, and non-coercive throughout the length of the entire encounter, and the consents given by the defendant were unhesitant and immediate.

   Trooper was permitted to stop defendant's vehicle after observing a cracked windshield, his questions to defendant and the passenger concerning their travel plans were acceptable, and the initial four-minute detention was not unreasonably prolonged. Because the traffic stop did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, he was not entitled to suppress evidence of methamphetamine and a digital scale seized from the vehicle or evidence of 23 bindles of cocaine seized from his person; defendant was convicted upon a plea of guilty to felony possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver and felony possession of cocaine with intent to deliver in violation of Wyo.

   Where an informant told a law enforcement agent that he was purchasing methamphetamine from three men staying at a local motel, the agent went to the motel, where he saw one of the men put something into a vehicle and drive away; when the agent saw the driver turn a corner without signaling, the agent was permitted to conduct a traffic stop under Wyo. Const. art. I, § 4. Therefore, the district court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of his backpack found in the car containing 20 grams of methamphetamine, 5 grams of cocaine, a digital scale, several razor blades, and packaging material; defendant was properly convicted of two counts of possession of a controlled substance in violation of Wyo.

   Although defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver because the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt essential elements of the crime, the appellate court was compelled to conclude that the evidence was sufficient. The foregoing was especially true in light of defendant's admission that he had sold marijuana in the past to supplement his income, and a search of defendant's home revealed the $100 bill an agent had used to purchase marijuana, which was inadvertently returned to the defendant's wife, as well as a box of plastic baggies, weighing scales, a marijuana sifter, and suspected marijuana and methamphetamine.

   Defendant was properly convicted of conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with the intent to deliver. The agreement of the conspiracy, to regain possession of the half pound of commercial methamphetamine in an accomplice's bag so that the accomplice could sell the methamphetamine, could be reasonably inferred from the communication between the accomplices and defendant regarding what occurred vis a vis the informant. The defendant's intentional or active participation in the conspiracy could reasonably be inferred from the relationship between the defendant and accomplices, the communication between them regarding what occurred vis a vis the informant, the defendant's role in the ensuing discussions at the defendant's residence and in his vehicle, the particular statements attributed to the defendant during these discussions, and the defendant's conduct at his residence and upon leaving the residence. The requisite intent could reasonably be inferred from the foregoing and additional evidence concerning the accomplice's stated purpose in regaining possession of the methamphetamine, the testimony regarding the significance of the quantity of the methamphetamine involved, and the testimony regarding the manner in which the methamphetamine was packaged.

       Incarceration justified for defendant selling drugs to youth and not accepting responsibility. —

     <p>
      
   Where the prosecutor and investigation report recommended incarceration, and there was testimony indicating that defendant had been selling drugs to young people and that he was unwilling to accept responsibility for his acts, the court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to incarceration. Yates v. State, 723 P.2d 37, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 592</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

   In a prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, the trial court erred in refusing to give a lesser-included offense instruction on possession of a controlled substance where the trial court was put on notice that a lesser-included offense instruction was being requested; possession of a controlled substance is a lesser-included offense of possession with intent to deliver; and the evidence cited by defendant, if believed, negated the inference of intent to sell.

       Charge dismissed with prejudice as discovery sanction. —

     <p>
      
   Even though district court had the authority, under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2), to dismiss a criminal drug charge against defendant with prejudice for the State's failure to produce a police report containing defendant's statement, it abused its discretion by doing so without conducting the appropriate inquiry to determine whether the sanction was justified. The district court made no findings as to the reasons why the State did not produce the report, it made no findings about the prejudice that would be suffered by defendant if the charge was not dismissed with prejudice, and it did not discuss whether prejudice could be cured by a less severe sanction such as a continuance.

       Separate sentences proper. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      
   Separate sentences for possession and possession with intent to deliver were proper because the evidence presented at trial showed that defendant possessed methamphetamine both for his own use and for delivery to others. The evidence also showed that agents found separate packages of methamphetamine in different quantities in several locations in and around defendant's residence.

   Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss a charge of felony possession of a controlled substance pursuant to the enhancement provisions of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 35-7-1031(c)(i) because defendant's waiver of the right to counsel in a prior misdemeanor proceeding was knowing and intelligent; the advisements given in the prior proceeding complied with Wyo.

   State prisoner was not entitled to habeas relief under 28 U.S.C.S. § 2241 because his Double Jeopardy Clause rights were not violated by the refusal of the Wyoming Board of Parole to hold a parole revocation proceeding while he was serving an Arizona sentence after he had absconded while on parole for convictions under Wyo.

   Where police officers responded to a report that the odor of burning marijuana was emanating from an apartment where minors were present, defendant retrieved from her bedroom a wooden box containing a small amount of marijuana and other paraphernalia. The corporal testified that three juveniles admitted that they had smoked marijuana and defendant admitted that she supplied the drugs; the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for three felony counts of delivery of a controlled substance to a minor in violation of this section.

      Whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this act or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana, or stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of possession of a controlled substance under W.S. 35-7-1031(c) or 35-7-1033(a)(iii)(B), or pleads guilty to or is found guilty of using or being under the influence of a controlled substance under W.S. 35-7-1039, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place him on probation upon terms and conditions. Any term of probation imposed under this section for a felony offense shall not exceed the maximum term of probation authorized under W.S. 7-13-302(b). Upon violation of a term or condition, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided. Upon fulfillment of the terms and conditions, the court shall discharge the person and dismiss the proceedings against him. Discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of this section or for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime, including the additional penalties imposed for second or subsequent convictions under W.S. 35-7-1038. There may be only one (1) discharge and dismissal under this section with respect to any person. This section shall not be construed to provide an exclusive procedure. Any other procedure provided by law relating to suspension of trial or probation, may be followed, in the discretion of the trial court.

   It was proper for the indictment to charge possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, and it was also proper that both alleged violations be tried in one proceeding because they were of similar character and based on the same act or transaction or, at the very least, on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.

   Where the indictment charged defendant with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, even though both counts could be brought under the same complaint (both counts could be tried at the same time, the same witnesses could testify in the proof of each charge insofar as their testimony was relevant, material and competent, or otherwise admissible, and the same evidence could be received to support each count), the defendant could not be convicted and sentenced to prison for more than one offense. There was but one transaction, one common scheme or plan, and, because one offense was merged with another, the convictions may not be stacked because the result would be to have twice placed the defendant in jeopardy in that he would have received multiple punishment for the same offense at one trial.

   The delivery statute targets the delivery of drugs while the conspiracy statute is directed at prevention of partnerships in crime. Refusal to merge counts under the two statutes would therefore not involve a double jeopardy violation.

   Defendant was properly convicted of conspiracy to possess methamphetamine with the intent to deliver. The agreement of the conspiracy, to regain possession of the half pound of commercial methamphetamine in an accomplice's bag so that the accomplice could sell the methamphetamine, could be reasonably inferred from the communication between the accomplices and defendant regarding what occurred vis a vis the informant. The defendant's intentional or active participation in the conspiracy could reasonably be inferred from the relationship between the defendant and accomplices, the communication between them regarding what occurred vis a vis the informant, the defendant's role in the ensuing discussions at the defendant's residence and in his vehicle, the particular statements attributed to the defendant during these discussions, and the defendant's conduct at his residence and upon leaving the residence. The requisite intent could reasonably be inferred from the foregoing and additional evidence concerning the accomplice's stated purpose in regaining possession of the methamphetamine, the testimony regarding the significance of the quantity of the methamphetamine involved, and the testimony regarding the manner in which the methamphetamine was packaged.

   The standard of review in considering whether a no-knock search warrant was properly issued is similar to the court's review of whether there was probable cause to issue a search warrant; just as when reviewing probable cause, the court shall afford the issuing judge's determination great deference upon appeal and the determination must be reviewed under a totality of the circumstances test.

   After concluding probable cause exists to issue a search warrant, the issuing judge should separately consider whether exigent circumstances justify execution of a search warrant without the requirement of first knocking and announcing the purpose for the police presence; the appropriate test is whether the police information obtained in advance shows reasonable cause to believe exigent circumstances as set forth in the statute exist which would endanger the successful execution of the warrant.

   Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possessing a controlled substance precursor with intent to engage in a clandestine laboratory operation where the jury was instructed that ephedrine, hydriotic acid, pseudoephedrine, acetone, hydrochloric acid, and iodine, which were List I and II controlled substance precursors, were found in a box in the apartment, and both defendant and his roommate had access to that box.

   Defendant's conviction for engaging in an unlawful clandestine laboratory operation was affirmed, where the totality of the circumstances and accompanying inferences, including the nature of defendant's association with a driver and a vehicle, defendant's fingerprints, the stains observed on scales found in the vehicle, defendant's hands, and a towel retrieved from defendant's belongings, in addition to defendant's own statements and the evidence contained in her possessions, established a direct nexus between defendant, a water cooler and its contents, and the other items that comprised the clandestine laboratory operation.

   Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of possessing a controlled substance precursor with intent to engage in a clandestine laboratory operation because the jury was instructed that ephedrine, hydriotic acid, pseudoephedrine, acetone, hydrochloric acid, and iodine, which were List I and II controlled substance precursors, were found in a box in the apartment, and both defendant and his roommate had access to that box.

A practitioner who prescribes a schedule V controlled substance shall only be required to search the program as otherwise provided in this subsection if the substance is an opioid. A dispenser, other than a veterinarian, shall electronically file with the board information regarding any prescription for a schedule II, III, IV or V controlled substance dispensed by the dispenser no later than the close of business on the business day immediately following the day the controlled substance was dispensed.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The proceeds arising from the sale of lots in any cemetery by any person, firm, corporation or municipality, and all other income and revenue thereof, shall be exclusively applied, appropriated or used in improving, preserving and embellishing such cemetery, and its appurtenances, and to paying the necessary operating expenses thereof, and shall not be applied or appropriated to any purpose of profit to the person, firm, corporation or municipality owning or maintaining same; provided, that any mutual cemetery corporation or municipality may use such income and revenue for purchasing or acquiring additional adjacent grounds for cemetery purposes only; provided, however, any cemetery organized by any individual, group of individuals, corporation or association, except municipal corporations and duly organized cemetery districts shall establish a perpetual care fund in an amount equal to at least ninety cents ($.90) for each square foot of cemetery lot sold after the effective date of this act. In support of, and for the protection of such perpetual care fund, there shall be established a trust fund in such amount and under such terms and conditions, including bonded protection of a permanent and enduring nature, as the insurance commissioner of the state of Wyoming may prescribe to carry out the objectives and contractual commitments and trust of such individual, corporation or association. In the case of the operation of a mausoleum for the sale of vaults or crypts therein the perpetual care fund shall be twenty percent (20%) of the purchase price. Such fund shall be operated as a perpetual trust according to requirements approved by the insurance department, and shall be used for the benefit of the grave sales and cemetery lots for which deposits shall have been made. The insurance commissioner shall specify securities approved for the investment of the funds which shall include investment of funds with a duly licensed Wyoming bank, trust company, or federal building and loan association, and may require an audit of all of the books and accounts of the cemetery as the need may arise. The cemetery organization shall file a copy of a purchase contract or installment contract for lot or lots, if any there be, with the insurance commissioner when said contract is entered into and shall forthwith notify the insurance commissioner of the final payment or default, if any be made, of such contract or contracts. Any and all funds received and invested as stipulated in this act, and the income therefrom, shall be as a trust and shall not be liable to attachment, garnishment, or other processes, nor shall be seized, taken or appropriated or applied by any legal or equitable processes or operation of law to pay any debt or liability of the person, partnership, association, company or corporation organizing or thereafter operating such cemetery.

       Authority to declare abandoned unoccupied lots; procedure; resale.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any city, town or special cemetery district may declare abandoned the ownership of any unoccupied lots or parcels of land in municipally owned cemeteries, created under and by virtue of W.S. 35-8-201 through 35-8-211, inclusive, or any special cemetery district whenever there has been no contact with or knowledge of the owners, heirs, or assigns, as the case may be, of such lots or parcels for more than twenty-five (25) years. Prior to declaring such abandonment, notice shall be served by registered mail at the last known address of such owner, heirs, or assigns. In the event that the address cannot be ascertained, notice shall be given by one (1) publication in the official newspaper of the municipality or special cemetery district in which the cemetery is located. Said notice shall allow thirty (30) days for the owner, heirs, or assigns to advise the city or town or special cemetery district of his identity and address; and if he does so, the city or town or special cemetery district shall not declare the abandonment. Upon the failure of the owner, heirs, or assigns to so communicate with the city or town, it may by resolution declare such lots or parcels abandoned. Thereafter, it may resell such lots or parcels, but shall place in trust an amount of money equivalent to the original selling price of such lots or parcels for payment to the owner, heirs, or assigns. Said trust fund shall be placed in legal investments, and the interest received therefrom shall annually be deposited to the city’s or town’s general fund or the general fund of the special cemetery district. Money received from the resale of such lots and parcels and deposited in said trust fund may be withdrawn by the cities or towns or the special cemetery district and placed in their general fund if not claimed by the owner, heirs, or assigns within twenty-five (25) years after being so deposited. So long as such lots or parcels remain unsold, the owners, heirs, or assigns may reclaim them by identifying themselves and establishing their right to such lots or parcels.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If the state fire marshal, county fire warden or the chief of a fire department or district finds combustible materials or flammable conditions or fire hazards in a building or on premises subject to an inspection and the materials or conditions are dangerous to the safety of the buildings, premises or public, the officer shall order the materials to be removed or conditions remedied. The order shall be in writing and shall be served upon the owner, lessee, agent or occupant. A person who is served and fails to comply within twenty-four (24) hours after service, unless the order prescribes a longer time, is guilty of a misdemeanor. The material may be removed or the condition corrected at the expense of any person served. The state fire marshal, county fire warden or the chief of a fire department or district may maintain actions for the recovery of the expenses. In the event of a hazard of immediate life threatening severity, the state fire marshal, county fire warden or the chief of a fire department or district may order evacuation of a building or area and may implement emergency measures to protect life and property and to remove the hazard.

If the subject of the site or premise is commercial real estate, the incident commander shall limit the declaration of uninhabitable or contaminated to the areas affected by the clandestine laboratory operation and shall not declare the entire commercial real estate uninhabitable or contaminated unless the entire commercial property has been documented and determined uninhabitable or contaminated using the standards promulgated by the state emergency response commission under W.S. 35-9-153(h). The incident commander shall provide written notice to the commercial real estate owner, describing with specificity the extent of the commercial property deemed uninhabitable or contaminated. Any property that is ordered uninhabitable or contaminated under this subsection shall only be transferred or sold prior to remediation if full, written disclosure is made to the prospective purchaser, attached to the earnest money receipt if any, and shall accompany the sale documents but not be a part of the deed nor shall it be recorded. The transferor or seller shall notify the incident commander of the transfer or sale within ten (10) days of the transfer or sale. Receipt of full written disclosure under this subsection constitutes a full release of liability on the part of the seller or transferor and acceptance of liability on the part of the buyer or transferee unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the transferor and transferee.

      <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1a">
       The decision to commence a civil action to recover expenses shall be made by the state, political subdivision of the state or other unit of local government, including local emergency response authorities and regional response teams, in consultation with the attorney general or county or municipal attorney as appropriate. With respect to a civil action to recover expenses for a clandestine laboratory operation incident, the governing body shall first make such claim against the party responsible for the clandestine laboratory operation and shall use the proceeds of any asset forfeiture directly related to the building or structure containing the clandestine laboratory to offset expenses, including expenses for remediation of the site. Claims of expenses for remediation for a clandestine laboratory operation incident may be made against the owner of a building or structure containing a clandestine laboratory operation only as follows:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1ai">
         The law enforcement agency acting as an emergency responder shall keep an accurate account of the expenses incurred in carrying out the remediation and shall report the actions and present a statement of the expenses incurred and the amount received from any salvage sale to the court for approval and allowance;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1aii">
         The court shall examine, correct, if necessary, and allow the expense account to the extent the expenses exceed those recovered from the party responsible for the clandestine laboratory operation. If the owner did not know or could not with reasonable diligence have known of the clandestine laboratory operation, the amount recoverable from the owner shall be limited to one percent (1%) of the fair market value as determined by the county assessor of that portion of the building, structure or land declared uninhabitable by the incident commander;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1aiii">
         The amount allowed by the court constitutes a lien against the real property on which a clandestine laboratory operation incident occurred or was situated. If the amount is not paid by the owner within six (6) months after the amount has been examined and approved by the court, the real estate may be sold under court order by the county sheriff in the manner provided by law for the sale of real estate upon execution;

        <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1aiv">
         The proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the treasury of the governing body of the law enforcement agency acting as the emergency responder. If the amount received as salvage or upon sale exceeds the expenses allowed by the court, the court shall direct payment of the surplus to the previous owner for his use and benefit;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c09a01d05s35-9-158ol1av">
         Whenever any debt which is a lien pursuant to this subsection is paid and satisfied, the law enforcement agency acting as an emergency responder shall file notice of satisfaction of the lien statement in the office of the county clerk of any county in which the lien is filed; and

If the expenses further exceed amounts available under W.S. 1-40-118(g)(i)(C), the emergency responder may apply for reimbursement from the clandestine laboratory remediation account created pursuant to W.S. 35-9-159(f).

At least one (1) complete band shall be located at least fifteen (15) millimeters from the lighting end of the cigarette. Cigarettes on which the bands are positioned by design shall have at least two (2) bands fully located at least fifteen (15) millimeters from the lighting end and at least ten (10) millimeters from the filter end of the tobacco column. For nonfiltered cigarettes the bands shall be at least ten (10) millimeters from the labeled end of the tobacco column.

   Assuming extraction and production activities relate to minerals, the board of county commissioners cannot prohibit those activities, but it can regulate such activities so long as they are not regulated under the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act. River Springs Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 899 P.2d 1329, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 125</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

   A county can prohibit the extraction or processing of sand, gravel, rock, and limestone pursuant to its zoning authority, but a “grandfathered” use cannot be prohibited. River Springs Ltd.

   If the county permits the extraction, production, or processing of sand, gravel, rock, or limestone, or must do so because the use was a preexisting use, then regulation of those activates is accomplished under the EQA by the DEQ. If, however, the DEQ, pursuant to an exception in the statute, does not regulate those activities, they may be regulated by the county in a way that does not conflict with state regulation.

      Laws 2005, ch. 125, § 1, directs the state health officer and the department of health in collaboration with the Wyoming department of agriculture and the Wyoming department of environmental quality to convene a multi-disciplinary task force to conduct a study of environmental health issues currently identified, the state and federal agencies to whom those issues are currently assigned and those environmental health threats identified but not clearly assigned to a particular state agency. The study is to examine overlapping governmental jurisdiction and jurisdictional gaps in environmental health matters and, to the extent needed, recommend solutions to these problems. The department is to produce and submit a comprehensive plan to coordinate and clarify agency responsibility for environmental health issues, together with recommendations for any initial legislation, to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee by November 15, 2005. The act appropriates $50,000 from the general fund to the department of health to implement the purposes of this act and further provides that the department of health may use existing resources and apply for any federal or private grants that may be available to augment funding for the required study and plan.

    Legal obligation imposed on council by legislature

    Section 35-11-109 and this section discuss general powers and responsibilities of director and council respectively,
    

   and are general provisions which provide authority for the promulgation of regulations and standards “necessary,” and not on an assembly-line basis which would cause an undesirable inflexibility in the agency's functioning and impair its ability to deal with specialized problems.

   The environmental quality council (EQC) cannot, pursuant to subsection (a)(v), classify lands within the state as “very rare or uncommon” without adopting by regulation the criteria or factors that will establish a standard for such a classification; in the absence of factors or criteria established by regulation, the phrase “very rare or uncommon” is too amorphous to permit judicial review of the action of the EQC, as required by statute; and classifications made on an ad hoc basis are inherently arbitrary and capricious.

Sess., ch. 75, § 1, and Laws 2004, ch. 38, § 1, creates a carbon sequestration advisory committee, which is to assist the director of the department of agriculture in assessing agricultural and forest lands in Wyoming for past carbon sequestration and future carbon sequestration potential, recommend policies or programs to enhance the ability of Wyoming agricultural and forest landowners to participate in systems of carbon trading, encourage the production of educational and advisory materials regarding carbon sequestration and carbon or greenhouse emissions trading, and identify and recommend areas of research needed to better understand and quantify the processes of carbon sequestration on agricultural and forest lands. On or before December 1, 2001, the director, in consultation with the advisory committee, is to prepare a report to the legislature, to include (1) the potential for greenhouse emissions regulation, (2) the potential for development of a system of carbon emission trading or markets for sequestered carbon, (3) agricultural and forest practices, management systems or lands uses which increase stored soil carbon and minimize carbon dioxide or other greenhouse emissions, (4) methods for measuring and modeling net carbon sequestration and greenhouse emissions reduction, and legislation to define and protect property rights in carbon sequestration and greenhouse emissions, (5) areas of scientific uncertainty with respect to quantifying and understanding greenhouse emission reductions or soil carbon sequestration, and (6) recommendations. The act creates the carbon sequestration assessment cash fund to carry out the purposes of this act and appropriates $35,600 from the budget reserve account to the department of agriculture for such purposes. Additionally, it appropriates from the general fund to the department of agriculture $35,600, or as much thereof as is necessary, for purposes of this act.

      <li id="t35c11a03s35-11-309ol1a">
       The legislature declares that all water, including collections of still water and waters associated with wetlands within the borders of this state are property of the state. The legislature further declares that water is one of Wyoming’s most important natural resources, and the protection, development and management of Wyoming’s water resources is essential for the long-term public health, safety, general welfare and economic security of Wyoming and its citizens.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c11a03s35-11-309ol1b">
       The legislature finds that agriculture, energy development, mining, highway construction and timbering are important industries in this state and that industrial concerns must be accommodated in the protection of wetlands. Wetlands can have an impact on industry practices. Even though property taxes are generally paid on such lands, wetlands provide limited economic return to the landowner. Wetland policies can obstruct water development projects and water management projects for private industry as well as public entities and can affect other developments.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c11a03s35-11-309ol1c">
       The legislature finds that wetlands are considered important for a variety of reasons. Wetlands provide the habitat base for the production and maintenance of waterfowl and are sometimes critical to the survival of endangered plants and animals. Wetlands also serve to moderate water flow and have value as natural flood control mechanisms, can aid in water purification by trapping, filtering and storing sediment and other pollutants and by recycling nutrients, and can serve as groundwater recharge and discharge areas. Wetlands also function as nursery areas for numerous aquatic animal species and are habitat for a wide variety of plant and animal species, and provide vital habitat for resident wildlife. Wetlands also can provide scientific, aesthetic and recreational benefits. The legislature therefore concludes that wetlands and values associated therewith deserve to be effectively managed, protected and preserved.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c11a03s35-11-309ol1d">
       The legislature recognizes that significant differences exist in Wyoming between naturally occurring wetlands and those wetlands that result from human activities. Because portions of Wyoming are arid or semiarid, water was diverted from streams and rivers for irrigating cropland, resulting in the creation of wetlands. These wetlands have partially compensated for wetlands losses. Additionally, road and highway construction, petroleum industry operations and other human activities have created wetlands where none previously existed. While these man-made wetlands are equally as important as naturally occurring wetlands, having the same characteristics and providing the same values and functions, management flexibility is required to acknowledge their different origins and to protect the property rights of landowners and water right holders.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c11a03s35-11-309ol1e">
       In view of the legislative findings and conclusions of the importance of wetlands, water development and management, and industry in Wyoming it is hereby declared to be the wetlands policy of this state that water management and development and wetland preservation activities should be balanced to protect and accommodate private property, industry, water and wetland interests and objectives.

If the oil and gas operator does not convert to geologic sequestration, the wells shall be plugged and abandoned according to the rules of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. When determining whether an oil and gas recovery operation is injecting carbon dioxide for the primary purpose of long term storage that results in an increased risk to an underground source of drinking water as compared to enhanced oil recovery operations, the director shall consider the findings and recommendations of the supervisor of the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. The supervisor shall make his determination following a hearing of the oil and gas conservation commission examiners held under the commission’s rules and regulations promulgated under Title 30, Chapter 5 of the Wyoming statutes. The supervisor shall provide the operator and director with notice of the supervisor’s findings and recommendations under this subsection and an opportunity for a public hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission. Within fifteen (15) days of receiving notice as provided in this subsection, the operator may request a hearing before the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission.

       A mining permit is the certification that the tract of land described may be mined by an operator licensed to do so in conformance with an approved mining plan and reclamation plan. No mining operation may be commenced or conducted on land for which there is not in effect a valid mining permit to which the operator possesses the rights.

       All surface coal mining permits issued subsequent to approval of the state program pursuant to P.L. 95-87 shall be issued for a term of not to exceed five (5) years. If the applicant demonstrates that a specified longer term is reasonably needed to allow the applicant to obtain necessary financing for equipment and the opening of the operation and if the application is complete for this specified longer term, the director shall grant a permit for a longer term.

    Long-term lessee of land or holder of right-of-way easement is not “surface landowner”

   Condemnation of a way of necessity for a railroad spur track and a mine truck haul road, according to statute, dispenses with the statutory requirement that a resident or agricultural landowner or a surface landowner consent to mining operations, or an order in lieu of such consent in the case of the latter kind of ownership, be included in an application for a mining permit, since after condemnation of such an easement the owner of the servient estate is not a surface owner for purposes of this section.

       In those instances in which the surface owner is not the owner of the mineral estate proposed to be mined by mining operations a permit shall not be issued without the execution of a bond or undertaking to the state, whichever is applicable, for the use and benefit of the surface owner or owners of the land, in an amount sufficient to secure the payment for any damages to the surface estate, to the crops and forage, or to the tangible improvements of the surface owner. This amount shall be determined by the administrator and shall be commensurate with the reasonable value of the surrounding land, and the effect of the overall operation of the landowner. This bond is in addition to the performance bond required for reclamation by this act. As damage is determined it shall be paid. Financial loss resulting from disruption of the surface owner’s operation shall be considered as part of the damage. A bond for surface damage shall not be required when the agreement negotiated between the surface owner and the mineral owner or developer waives any requirement therefor. Payment of damages shall be paid annually unless otherwise agreed to by the surface owner and the operator.

         Solid wastes shall be screened by the facility operator in a manner approved by the director to assure to the maximum practical extent that wastes prohibited from disposal at the facility are not managed or disposed of at the facility. Management or disposal of any prohibited waste by a facility shall be cause for the council to issue a cessation order preventing continued receipt of solid wastes at the facility. The order shall remain in effect until the director approves a revised waste screening plan submitted by the facility operator which the director deems sufficient to prevent receipt of wastes prohibited from disposal at the facility;

       Any person who owns or is in control of any real or personal property, any plant, building, structure, process or equipment may apply to the administrator of the appropriate division for a variance from any rule, regulation, standard or permit promulgated under this act. A variance may be granted upon notice and hearing. The administrator shall give public notice of the request for a variance in the county in which such real or personal property, plant, building, structure, process or equipment is in existence for which the variance is sought. The notice shall designate who has applied for the variance and the nature of the variance requested and the time and place of hearing and shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in said county once a week for four (4) consecutive weeks prior to the date of the hearing. The cost of publication shall be paid by the person applying for the variance. The administrator of the division shall promptly investigate the request, consider the views of the persons who may be affected by the grant of the variance, and all facts bearing on the request, and make a decision with the approval of the director within sixty (60) days from the date the hearing for a variance is held.

       A variance may be granted by the council from standards established by the council for sulfur oxide emissions, if the council determines that the state of the technology for removal of sulfur oxides from the stack gasses is insufficiently advanced to achieve the objective level without causing undue economic hardship on the owner of the facility or the consumer of the product produced by the facility or if the council determines that the developing technology offers promise that superior equipment might, in the near future, be available which would render presently available equipment obsolete and that the best interests of the state would be served by the issuance of the variance. In considering such a variance, the council must consider the health and well being of the citizens in the vicinity of the facility and the effect upon livestock and agricultural production in the area. In no event shall the variance permit emissions less stringent than existing federal standards covering the emission of sulfur oxides. Each application for a variance will be issued on a case by case basis considering the state of the technology at the time of each application.

     <p>
      

    Basic reason for this distinction
    

   is that it is required to bring the state provisions into compliance with the federal regulations, which only provide for “schedules of compliance” — not variances. United States Steel Corp. v. Wyoming Envtl. Quality Council, 575 P.2d 749, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 270</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

       Prohibition of water variances not unconstitutional. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      
   A prohibition of water variances does not violate art. 1, § 7, Wyo. Const., in that it is an exercise of absolute and arbitrary power; does not deny due process by denying a fair opportunity to challenge applicable water quality standards; and does not deny equal protection of the laws by discriminating between water and other pollutant dischargers. United States Steel Corp. v. Wyoming Envtl. Quality Council, 575 P.2d 749, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 270</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      
   Given various means by which a corporation could present its views as to a water turbidity standard, including opportunity to participate in the promulgation process and to assure that there was procedural compliance, opportunity to obtain judicial review, if it was affected in fact by the rule adopted, and opportunity to seek the amendment or repeal of the rule, the corporation's rights to procedural due process were not infringed by the prohibition of water variances under subsection (o) of this section. United States Steel Corp. v. Wyoming Envtl. Quality Council, 575 P.2d 749, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 270</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
     </p>
     <p>
      
   There are rational reasons to distinguish between water and other pollutant dischargers, including: the different nature of the natural resources; the difference in the number of pollutant dischargers within each class; and the difference in the extent of damage which can result from the various discharges. United States Steel Corp. v. Wyoming Envtl. Quality Council, 575 P.2d 749, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 270</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

   By including the language “pursuant to the provisions of this act,” the legislature expressly defined the property which was subject to the ad valorem tax exemption articulated in this section as being property having to do with environmental quality and distinguished that property from other types of property, which were exempt from ad valorem taxation; the legislature did not limit the exemption to property required by the Department of Environmental Quality or federal environmental protection agencies. 872 P.2d 1163, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo.

   Since the department of revenue and taxation exempted pollution control equipment during construction for a considerable period of time without the legislature's making any statutory changes, court inferred that this interpretation was consistent with legislative intent.

   In determining the tax exemption of pollution control equipment, the state board of equalization (now the department of revenue) need not consider the recommendation of the county assessor.

   The state board of equalization (now the department of revenue) correctly interprets this section by not considering operating costs in determining the amount of value of pollution control equipment for ad valorem taxation.

   The State Board of Equalization exceeded its statutory authority by adopting a rule which allowed the ad valorem tax exemption for only property which was required by the state or federal environmental protection agencies and by adopting a rule which did not allow the exemption for monitoring devices. 872 P.2d 1163, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo.

      <li id="t35c11a14s35-11-1414ol1b">
       The legislature recognizes the threat to the public health, safety, welfare and the environment caused by pollution to soil and water from underground and aboveground storage tanks. The purpose of this article is to take primacy of the underground storage tank program and to provide funding to take corrective actions at sites contaminated by underground storage tanks and aboveground storage tanks.

      <li id="t35c11a14s35-11-1414ol1c">
       The legislature also recognizes that owners and operators cannot take corrective action without placing their businesses’ existence in financial jeopardy. The legislature finds that, because Wyoming is a large rural state, it is in the public interest to take corrective action at contaminated sites so that fuel will continue to be readily available throughout Wyoming.

The annual fee per site required under this subsection shall be paid for a maximum of ten (10) years and shall then lapse until corrective action is undertaken by the department. Failure to meet these requirements may subject the person who owns the site to suit for corrective action or cost recovery.

Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit the imposition of remediation requirements to address the release of a contaminant which may occur after a remedy agreement has been entered into or a no further action letter has been issued.

The one in one million (1 in 1,000,000) risk level shall be used as the point of departure for determining remediation goals for alternatives when individual contaminant standards are not available, or are not sufficiently protective because of the presence of multiple contaminants at a site or multiple pathways of exposures. Site-specific, risk-based standards must also require that for contaminants which are systemic toxicants, the hazard index must not exceed one (1). The director shall use residential exposure factors, giving consideration to children and the elderly, to establish site-specific, risk-based standards under this subsection for soils and air. The exposure factors to be used by the director to establish site-specific, risk-based standards under this subsection for hazardous substances in groundwater shall assume that groundwater may be used as a drinking water source, provided that no standard set under this subsection for a contaminant shall be set at a level or concentration lower than the background level or concentration for that contaminant.

        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bi">
         The extent to which the remedy will be reliable and effective for the long term. For remedies that include engineering or institutional controls in accord with a use control area designation, the director shall consider the expected life cycle performance of any engineering controls, monitoring systems and institutional controls;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bii">
         The extent to which the remedy results in a reduction of toxicity, mobility or volume of contaminants. The director shall consider the degree to which remedies incorporate treatment or removal of contaminants to lower long term risk to human health and the environment;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1biii">
         The short term effectiveness of the remedy. The director shall consider the time required for each remedy to attain standards for air, soil and water specified in paragraph (a)(ii) or subsection (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable. A remedy involving monitored natural attenuation may be considered whether or not the director has made a determination of technical impracticability under subsection (d) of this section. Monitored natural attenuation shall be deemed effective if there is evidence that natural attenuation is occurring and will be completed within a reasonable time period;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1biv">
         Impacts which may be caused by implementation of the remedy. The director shall consider any adverse impacts which may be caused by a remedy, and shall take into consideration the gravity of any projected impact and the cost and availability of measures to mitigate the impact;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bv">
         The extent and nature of contamination and practicable capabilities of remedial technologies, and whether achieving standards is technically impracticable;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bvi">
         Reasonably anticipated future land uses or use restrictions in a use control area designation;

        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bvii">
         Consistency of remedies with the nature and complexities of releases of contaminants; and
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1bviii">
         Cost of the remedy. The director shall consider whether a remedy presents a substantial and disproportionately high cost for implementation and completion. The director shall compare the costs of remedies considering the degree of risk reduction that is afforded by each remedy. Costs considered shall include capital, operation and maintenance, engineering and institutional control costs and monitoring costs for the anticipated life of the remedy.

A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director under this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The alternate standards for such a site shall use the carcinogenic and systemic toxicant risk reduction goals of subparagraph (a)(ii)(B) of this section, except that the exposure assumptions used to calculate the alternate standards under this subsection shall be consistent with the use restrictions contained in the use control area designation. If the director establishes alternate soil standards under this subsection, the owner or operator must evaluate technologies that can meet the alternate soil standards. Owners or operators of eligible sites that implement remedies which achieve the alternate soil standards set under this subsection may be issued a certificate of completion and covenant not to sue pursuant to W.S. 35-11-1607. The soil standards of paragraph (a)(ii) of this section must be met if the owner or operator applies to remove the use restrictions applicable to the site or to receive a no further action letter under W.S. 35-11-1608.

A remedy that employs alternate standards established by the director under this subsection shall meet the requirements of this subsection and paragraphs (a)(i), (iii) and (iv) of this section. The technical impracticability determination shall include evaluation of the cost of remedy alternatives, including but not limited to, substantial and disproportionately high costs, present worth of construction, operation and maintenance costs, continued operational costs of the remedy selected and costs of any proposed alternative remedy strategies. Whenever the director sets an alternate standard, the director shall select a remedy capable of meeting the alternate standard and which is technically practicable, controls any sources of contamination to the extent technically practicable, and controls human and environmental exposures to contaminated air, soil or water. The director may establish alternate standards for soil or water under this subsection only if the owner has or obtains rights to control human or environmental exposures to contaminated media, and consents to impose such controls as are required to protect human health and the environment. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(i) of this section, or W.S. 35-11-1609 such controls may be imposed by the owner without the site receiving a use control area designation under W.S. 35-11-1609.

         Compliance with groundwater standards shall be monitored as close as reasonably practical to the contaminant source or site boundary or boundary of the use control area. The director shall select any groundwater point of compliance based upon the evaluation of the properties of the aquifer, the proximity of existing and reasonably anticipated points of groundwater withdrawal or discharge to the surface, the location of the contaminant plume relative to the site or use control area boundary, the toxicity of the contaminant, the presence and proximity of multiple contaminant sources, the exposure and likelihood of actual exposure to contaminated groundwater, and the technical practicability of groundwater remediation;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1eii">

        <li id="t35c11a16s35-11-1605ol1eiii">
         For surface water, standards shall be met at the point where any release enters any surface water of the state consistent with applicable federal and state requirements. If sediments are affected by releases to surface water, a sediment point of compliance may also be established.

      Purpose of chapter. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     
   The pervasive regulatory scheme of this chapter was enacted to protect Wyoming's environment and the social and economic fabric of the communities affected by industrial development. Industrial Sitting Council v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Transp. Co., 660 P.2d 776, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 292</cite> (Wyo. 1983).
    </p>
    <p>
     

    This chapter provides especially for public participation
    

   in the decisions on projects such as the Laramie river station. Indeed, a purpose of establishing the industrial siting council was to receive from and disseminate to Wyoming citizens information upon which future industrial growth can be intelligently developed.

       Within forty-five (45) days from the date of completion of the hearing the council shall make complete findings, issue an opinion and render a decision upon the record, either granting or denying the application as filed, or granting it upon terms, conditions or modifications of the construction, operation or maintenance of the facility as the council deems appropriate. The council shall not consider the imposition of conditions which address impacts within the area of jurisdiction of any other regulatory agency in this state as described in the information provided in W.S. 35-12-110(b), unless the other regulatory agency requests that conditions be imposed. In considering the imposition of conditions requested by other agencies upon private lands, the council shall consider in the same manner and to the same extent any comments presented by an affected landowner. The council may consider direct or cumulative impacts not within the area of jurisdiction of another regulatory agency in this state. The council shall grant a permit either as proposed or as modified by the council if it finds and determines that:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1ai">
         The proposed facility complies with all applicable law;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1aii">
         The facility will not pose a threat of serious injury to the environment nor to the social and economic condition or inhabitants or expected inhabitants in the affected area;
        </li>
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1aiii">
         The facility will not substantially impair the health, safety or welfare of the inhabitants; and
        </li>
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1aiv">
         The applicant has financial resources to decommission and reclaim the facility. For facilities meeting the definition of W.S. 35-12-102(a)(vii)(E) the council shall also be required to find the applicant has financial resources to construct, maintain and operate the facility.

       If the council determines that the location of all or part of the proposed facility should be modified, it may condition its permit upon that modification, provided that the local governments, and persons residing therein, affected by the modification, have been given reasonable notice of the modification.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1d">
       The council shall issue with its decision, an opinion stating in detail its reasons for the decision. If the council decides to grant a permit for the facility, it shall issue the permit embodying the terms and conditions in detail, including the time specified to commence construction, which time shall be determined by the council’s decision as to the reasonable capability of the local government, most substantially affected by the proposed facility, to implement the necessary procedures to alleviate the impact. A copy of the decision shall be served upon each party.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1e">
       A permit may be issued conditioned upon the applicant furnishing a bond to the division in an amount determined by the director from which local governments may recover expenditures in preparation for impact to be caused by a facility if the permit holder does not complete the facility proposed. The permit holder is not liable under the bond if the holder is prevented from completing the facility proposed by circumstances beyond his control.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1f">
       Within ten (10) days from the date of the council’s decision, a copy of the findings and the council’s decision shall be served upon the applicant, parties to the hearing and local governments to be substantially affected by the proposed facility and filed with the county clerk of the county or counties to be primarily affected by the proposed facility. Notice of the decision shall be published in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation within the area to be affected by the proposed facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1g">
       Each approved facility enumerated under W.S. 35-12-102(a)(vii)(A) through (D) shall, on a quarterly basis, remit to the division a waste management surcharge to be deposited in the general fund. The surcharge amount is:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1gi">
         A minimum of ten dollars ($10.00) per short ton of solid wastes, including radioactive wastes, received at the facility, less a minimum of five dollars ($5.00) for each short ton of solid wastes removed at the facility and recycled or reused and less any amount credited against the surcharge pursuant to W.S. 35-11-503(b)(iv)(B); and
        </li>
        <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1gii">
         A minimum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per short ton of hazardous wastes received at the facility, less a minimum of three dollars ($3.00) for each short ton of hazardous wastes treated at the facility to reduce toxicity and long-term hazards to the environment.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1h">
       For applicants subject to W.S. 35-12-105(e), a permit may be issued conditioned upon the applicant furnishing a bond or other financial assurance acceptable to the division in an amount determined by the director to cover the cost of decommissioning and reclaiming the facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c12s35-12-113ol1j">
       The council may deny an application if the facility that is the subject of the application will unreasonably interfere with the development of a known and currently economically developable mineral resource within the proposed facility.

The petition for appeal by any party must include an express assumption of the cost of preparation of the complete written transcripts and record for the court. Upon receipt of a petition, the division shall deliver to the court a copy of the complete written transcript of the record of the proceeding before it and a copy of the council’s decision and opinion entered therein which shall constitute the record on judicial review.

   By rule, the industrial siting council (ISC) has created a procedure apart from the permit process by which its jurisdiction over the construction of an industrial facility may be challenged. Under it, the ISC jurisdiction may be challenged by filing an application for a certificate of insufficient jurisdiction. The district court has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal from the denial of a certificate of insufficient jurisdiction by the ISC. Industrial Siting Council v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Transp.

   This section cannot be construed to preclude a plaintiff's access to all information which is relevant to a doctor's accreditation, in a cause of action against a hospital for negligence in the accreditation and maintenance of qualified medical personnel. The privilege protects from discovery the records concerning the internal proceedings of the hospital committee, but does not exempt from discovery materials which the committee reviews in the course of carrying out its function, nor action which may be taken thereafter by the hospital as may be influenced by the committee decision. In short, privileged data does not include the materials reviewed by the committee, only those documents produced by the committee as notes, reports and findings in the review process. Greenwood v.

      Remedies of a mobile home buyer or other person under the warranty provided in W.S. 35-18-103 and 35-18-104 are those otherwise provided by law.

The contractual waiver of any remedies under any law and the waiver, exclusion, modification or limitation of any warranty, express or implied, including the implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, is expressly prohibited, is contrary to public policy and is unenforceable and void unless permitted by this act.

   Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of third degree sexual assault and intentional abuse of a vulnerable adult because his continued contact after the victim said “no” and his grabbing her hand and placing it on his genitals constituted physical force reasonably calculated to cause submission; he knew or reasonably should have known that the victim through a mental deficiency or developmental disability was incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct as several witnesses testified that the victim’s physical characteristics and speech made her disability apparent; and, despite his intoxication, defendant was capable of forming the intent to abuse a vulnerable adult as he appeared coherent and oriented to time and place.

   There was sufficient evidence to establish that the victim was a vulnerable adult, including his daughter's testimony that the victim suffered form memory loss, alcoholism, and other mental problems, and defendant's acknowledgement that she knew about the victim's problems with alcohol, PTSD, and memory from personal observation and access to his medical records.

   Evidence was sufficient to show that the victim was a vulnerable adult because it showed that he, because of his physical disabilities, was unable to care for himself without assistance. While the evidence showed that Jesus could do some things without assistance, it also showed that he needed assistance to carry out some basic life activities such as cleaning himself and getting to doctor appointments.

       Household member. —

   When defendant convicted of battery against a household member did not rebut presentence information confirming that the victim of his prior battery and aggravated assault was the mother of his child, the evidence was sufficient to prove that she was a household member for purposes of this section. Because the State proved that defendant had two prior offenses using the presentence investigation report and copies of his prior judgments, the district court was permitted to impose felony punishment for a third offense of battery against a household member.

   When defendant was charged with strangulation of a household member, an alleged factual dispute about whether defendant and the victim were household members, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § Wyo. Stat.

       An adult or emancipated minor may execute a power of attorney for health care, which may authorize the agent to make any health care decision the principal could have made while having capacity. The power must be in writing and signed by the principal or by another person in the principal’s presence and at the principal’s expressed direction. The power remains in effect notwithstanding the principal’s later incapacity and may include individual instructions. Unless related to the principal by blood, marriage or adoption, an agent may not be an owner, operator or employee of a residential or community care facility at which the principal is receiving care. The durable power of attorney must be acknowledged before a notarial officer or must be signed by at least two (2) witnesses, each of whom witnessed either the signing of the instrument by the principal or the principal’s acknowledgement of the signature or of the instrument, each witness making the following declaration in substance:

In determining the patient’s best interest, the surrogate shall consider the patient’s personal, philosophical, religious and ethical values to the extent known to the surrogate and reliable oral or written statements previously made by the patient, including, but not limited to, statements made to family members, friends, health care providers or religious leaders.

The legislature intends by provisions of this chapter, that approval of cooperative arrangements among health care providers, purchasers and third party payors be accompanied by appropriate conditions and ongoing supervision and regulation of the operations of the cooperative arrangements, in order to protect against any abuses and to effectively except the actions of approved and regulated cooperative arrangements from state and federal antitrust liability.

       Subject to approval of the state plan by the United States secretary of health and human services, and subject to available state and federal funding the department shall provide a health insurance plan for an eligible child whose monthly gross family income is not more than two hundred percent (200%) of the federal poverty level. A child who is determined eligible to receive benefits under this section shall remain eligible for twelve (12) months as long as the child resides in the state of Wyoming and has not yet attained nineteen (19) years of age. A child’s eligibility to receive benefits under this act shall be redetermined on an annual basis. A simplified application process, which includes minimum eligibility requirements, shall be provided throughout the state at various public and private establishments approved by the department of health. To be determined eligible to receive benefits under this section, a child shall not be eligible under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act, shall not have been covered under another health insurance plan for a minimum of one (1) month prior to application for coverage under this act or, upon birth, the child would not otherwise be covered by a public or private health insurance plan.

If the child health insurance plan required by subsection (a) of this section is provided through the department’s division, the department shall competitively procure the contract at least once every five (5) years.

       Subject to the availability of appropriations, the department shall undertake a colorectal cancer screening and prevention program for those who qualify as specified in subsection (c) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c25a02s35-25-204ol1b">
       Initially the screening and prevention program funded under this program shall consist of colonoscopies which shall consist of both the examination of the colon and rectum and the removal and pathological examination of polyps in accordance with the normal standards of care for colonoscopies. After July 1, 2008, the department may, by rule and regulation, authorize other forms of screening to participate in the program provided these other forms of screening are evidence based and are shown by the evidence to be as effective or as cost effective as traditional colonoscopies.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c25a02s35-25-204ol1c">
       Starting July 1, 2007 Wyoming residents with incomes at or below two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of the federal poverty level shall be eligible to participate in this program and this shall remain the standard if the biennial budget bill does not establish a different standard and unless a different standard is established pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c25a02s35-25-204ol1d">
       Eligibility for the program set forth in this section shall be limited to individuals who are Wyoming residents and have been so for at least one (1) year immediately prior to screening. The eligibility shall be for one (1) colonoscopy every ten (10) years, counting any done before the effective date of this act or before the individual became a Wyoming resident. However, the department on a case-by-case basis may authorize follow-up screening when medically indicated based on national evidence based guidelines. Eligibility shall be restricted to individuals who are at least fifty (50) years old and who have not become eligible for the federal Medicare program. In the event that analysis shows spending in the program will exceed the budget available, the department shall institute a waiting list.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c25a02s35-25-204ol1e">
       The department shall provide vouchers to eligible persons for reimbursement for a colonoscopy at the rate paid under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act for colonoscopies, including polyp removal. The person receiving a voucher under this subsection shall pay all other costs of the colonoscopy. When the funds appropriated for this program are expended, the department shall cease issuing vouchers under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t35c25a02s35-25-204ol1f">
       The department shall develop an internet based application process for determining individual eligibility. The result of a successful application may be a voucher that the individual may present to a provider the department has contracted with or may be an online statement of eligibility that the providers can access or both. The department may use city or county health departments, other public health offices, providers, advocacy groups and any other appropriate governmental or private entities to assist individuals in completing the application process.
