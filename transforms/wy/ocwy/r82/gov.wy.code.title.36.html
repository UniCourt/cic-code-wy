       The state forester shall provide for the disposal of any slash resulting from the harvest of forest products and may require forest management work through a forest product sales contract or a service contract. The state forester may, when deemed necessary, require a slash deposit or performance bond to cover the anticipated cost of any slash disposal or required management work as a guarantee of compliance with contract specifications.

      Court did not violate defendant's right to present a defense and to compulsory process because defendant identified the expert less than three days before trial, and if the expert's testimony was to be adequately “tested,” so as to facilitate the presentation of reliable evidence, the State must have been provided an opportunity to investigate the expert. Given such short notice by defendant, however, the State could not have assembled an adequate response to the expert's testimony prior to trial.

      The exercise of the power conferred upon the board to lease the lands of the state to parties which shall inure to the greatest benefit, and secure the largest revenue to the state, requires judgment and discretion. No inflexible rule is laid down for the guidance of the board in those matters. The judgment and discretion to be exercised is judicial in character, and in an application for the writ of mandamus, it is not proper for the supreme court to interpose its opinion and judgment in the place of that of the board, even if the conclusion which the latter has reached upon the facts should appear to have been erroneous.

      Under a “federal floor” provision in state natural gas leases, under which the state was entitled to receive the same royalty revenues that the federal government received from its leases in the same field, if other gas producers in the same field remitted royalties to the federal government and calculated on the basis of the Natural Gas Policy Act, 15 USCS § 3301 et seq., ceiling price plus tax reimbursements, state lease gas producers were required to calculate their state royalty payments on the same basis.

      The state was entitled to receive royalties on tax reimbursements for ad valorem, severance and conservation taxes under an “amount realized” provision set forth in natural gas leases entered into with a private corporation. Tax reimbursements were part of the “amount” that the corporation “realized” from the sale of the natural gas and the state's royalty was properly calculated under the basis of inclusion of the tax reimbursement amount in addition to the price received for the gas sold.

     <p>
      Companies, associations, or corporations operating or controlling irrigation systems, ditches, or reservoirs or other devices for the distribution of water for irrigation shall be authorized to levy and collect such reasonable and necessary assessments for the cost of operation, maintenance, repairs and improvements of such irrigation systems, ditches or reservoirs, and for the purpose of repaying money borrowed for such purposes, as may be authorized by a majority of the members of such companies, or associations, or fixed in the manner provided by the bylaws of such corporation. Payment of such assessments shall be the necessary requisite for the use of such reservoirs, irrigation systems or ditches for the storage or conveyance of water for the lands deeded or described in contracts for or deeds to proportionate interests in such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches upon which assessments are made, and in the event such assessments remain due and unpaid more than ten (10) days after the date fixed as the date of payment for the purpose, such companies, associations and corporations are authorized to close down any headgate or other diverting or measuring device used by any delinquent, or by any person in possession of or using such lands, and to refuse to allow the use of such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches for the purpose of storing water for or conveying water to the lands of such delinquents and refuse such delinquents the right to vote at any meeting of such company, association, or corporation, until such repair or maintenance assessment shall have been paid. Such companies, associations and corporations shall have a lien upon the proportionate interest in such reservoirs, irrigation systems and ditches, which shall become a first lien upon the lands deeded or described in contracts for or deeds to such proportionate interests for the amount of any unpaid assessments which may be enforced in a court of competent jurisdiction, as in the case of other liens. In all suits or actions to obtain a judgment on such account and to enforce the lien, when the plaintiff or complainant shall obtain judgment or decree, the costs, together with twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for attorney’s fees, shall be taxed or recovered from the adverse party. No restraining order, or order of injunction shall be issued against any such company, association or corporation unless applicant for same shall file a sufficient bond conditioned upon the immediate payment of all delinquent assessments if such shall be found by a competent court to be reasonable and just. This act [section] shall include all lands under any of the above named systems if water has been used or is being used in any one irrigation season and providing that water is in said canal, reservoir or ditches, subject to use of owners.

      Within three (3) years from the date of the certificate of location issued to an entryman on the Carey Act lands, the entryman shall appear before the director, who is hereby authorized to administer oaths in matters pertaining to the state of Carey Act lands in Wyoming, a judge or clerk of the district or circuit court of any state, or commissioner of the United States district court, and make final proof of reclamation, settlement, and occupation, which proof shall embrace evidence that he has a perpetual water right for the irrigable area of the tract of land so filed upon, sufficient in volume for the complete irrigation and reclamation thereof, and has cultivated and irrigated not less than one-fourth part of the irrigable area of said tract and not less than one-eighth of the entire tract filed upon, that he has resided upon the land for the period of time required by the rules of the board, and such further proof, if any, as may be required by the regulations of the department of the interior, or the board. The officer taking this proof shall be entitled to a fee of two dollars ($2.00), which fee shall be paid by the entryman, and shall be in addition to the price paid to the state for the land. All proofs so received shall be submitted by the director to the board, and shall be accompanied by the last and final payment for said land, and on the approval of the same by the said board, shall entitle the said entryman to a patent to said land, whenever said land shall be patented by the United States to the state; provided, that when the director shall take such final proofs, all fees received by him shall be turned in to the state treasury; provided further, that when an entryman fails to make final proof within three (3) years from the date of the issuance of the certificate of location, the board may in its discretion, after (60) days’ notice is given to the entryman by registered letter to his last known address, cancel the certificate of location and declare the land covered by such certificate open to entry.

Any such trust agreement may pledge or assign the revenues to be received, but shall not convey or mortgage the project or any part thereof. Any such trust agreement or any resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the commission in relation to the acquisition, leasing or licensing of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation and insurance of the project, the rates, admission fees, charges and rentals to be charged, and the custody, safeguarding and application of all moneys, and provision for the employment of managers, and consulting engineers in connection with the construction or operation of the project. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the commission. Any such trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of trusts, and may restrict the individual right of action of bondholders as is customary in trust agreements or trust indentures securing bonds or debentures of corporations. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement may contain such other provisions as the commission may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement may be treated as a part of the cost of the operation of the project.

The balance of the water and lands may be leased by the department, in consultation with the commission, for a term not less than five (5) years nor longer than ninety-nine (99) years. The length of the term of each individual lease shall be determined by the department, in consultation with the commission, in accordance with the value of the improvements proposed and actually placed upon the leasehold. The department may by rule provide for special use permits for limited purposes. The department may make rules and regulations with respect to the erection of buildings and improvements upon the individual leaseholds and may prescribe the plans and specifications of, and the materials to be used in the buildings to be erected. The department, in consultation with the commission, in any lease may provide for such plans and buildings and such use thereof as will best carry out the purposes of this chapter in retaining the lands and waters thereon for the treatment and cure of diseases and the pleasure of the general public. The department, in consultation with the commission, may conduct through pipes or otherwise any portion of the waters of the hot springs reserved for free use under this section and to provide baths and bathhouses for the use of the water at such rental or rates as it prescribes.

     <p>
      If any state lands are sold upon which surface improvements, including irrigation works of any kind, have been made by a lessee, or for which water rights or proportionate interests in irrigation, reservoirs, canals, or systems, have been acquired, the improvements, irrigation works and water rights shall be appraised under the direction of the board. The purchaser of the lands, upon which improvements and irrigation works have been made, or for which water rights have been acquired as herein provided for, shall pay the owner of such improvements, irrigation works or water rights, as the case may be, the contributory value thereof, and take a receipt therefor, and shall deliver the receipt to the director before he shall receive a patent or certificate of purchase. All such receipts shall be filed and preserved in the office of state lands and investments. For purposes of this section, “contributory value” means the increased value of the property after the lessee’s improvements are considered.

      Where certificate of sale of state lands provided that before patent should issue, purchaser must convey to the state all mineral and mining rights, mandamus would not issue to compel issuance of patent until such reconveyance of mineral and mining rights was made. Word “land” used in statute does not refer only to land as having an indefinite extent upwards and downwards so as to prevent sale of surface rights only; statute providing for conveyance of title in fee simple does not establish that title in fee simple cannot exist to the surface rights separate from the mineral and mining rights.
