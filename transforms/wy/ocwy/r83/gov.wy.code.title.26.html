     Revision of title. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>

    <p>
     Laws 2003, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, requests Congress to equalize the tax treatment of employer-provided and individually purchased health insurance by creating a tax credit for the full amount of insurance purchased by individuals since the high cost of health insurance has created a large number of uninsured citizens in the United States and the State, those without health insurance are less likely to receive adequate health care, insurance purchasing decisions are to a large extent made by employers and not insurance beneficiaries, overreliance on employer-provided health insurance impedes worker mobility, spiraling health care costs are in part caused by a lack of active consumer participation in health care markets, and employers can deduct the full cost of employee health insurance as a business expense, while individuals may not.

       Insurer and agent have fiduciary relationship. —

     </p>
     <p>
      By Wyoming statute, the relationship between the insurer and its agent is defined to be a fiduciary relation. United States v. Schwab, 88 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2903 (D. Wyo. 2000).
     </p>
     <p>
      Defendants all stood in a fiduciary relationship to the insurance companies for which they were agents or sub-agents selling insurance on behalf of the company, and in such a fiduciary relationship the defendants had a duty to disclose material information to the insurance company that would be relevant to the insurers' decisions to issue insurance policies to life insurance policy applicants. United States v. Schwab, 88 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2903 (D. Wyo. 2000).

       For the purpose of determining financial condition, ability to fulfill and manner of fulfillment of its obligations, the nature of its operations and compliance with law, the commissioner or any of his examiners may examine any insurer as often as he, in his sole discretion, deems advisable. He shall examine each insurer licensed in this state not less frequently than every five (5) years. Examination of a reciprocal insurer may include examination of its attorney-in-fact as to its transactions relating to the insurer. Examination of an alien insurer may be limited to its insurance transactions and affairs in the United States, except as the commissioner otherwise requires. In scheduling and determining the nature, scope and frequency of the examinations the commissioner shall consider such matters as the results of financial statement analyses and ratios, changes in management or ownership, actuarial opinions, reports of independent certified public accountants and other criteria as set forth in the Examiners’ Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and in effect when the commissioner exercises discretion under this section.

       Each examination shall be expeditious, fair and impartial. Upon determining that an examination should be conducted the commissioner or his designee shall issue an examination warrant appointing one (1) or more examiners to perform the examination and instructing them as to the scope of the examination. In conducting the examination the examiner shall observe those guidelines and procedures set forth in the Examiners’ Handbook adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The commissioner may also employ other guidelines or procedures as the commissioner deems appropriate. No examiner may be appointed by the commissioner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination under this act.

The cease and desist order shall have full force and effect as soon as it is received unless stayed by the commissioner pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. The cease and desist order shall be of no effect at the end of the second business day following its issuance unless the commissioner shall have obtained a temporary restraining order, pursuant to rule 65 of the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure or the person receiving the order shall have stipulated that it remain in effect pursuant to terms and conditions agreed upon by the commissioner and that person. Thereafter, the commissioner may seek such further orders of the court to enforce the cease and desist order as he deems appropriate or necessary. If a temporary restraining order is sought in accordance with this subsection, the cease and desist order shall remain in effect until the temporary restraining order or any extension thereof is denied, or until the cease and desist order is modified or stayed by an order of the court. The action seeking the temporary restraining order shall be filed in the district court for Laramie county or in the district court for the county in which person affected by the order resides or has his principal place of business.

      It would be improper to grant certain injunctive relief requested by the insurance commissioner, i.e., the direct payment of the tax debt of an unknown amount for certain years, the direct report of the proportion of the premiums collected on persons, subjects or risks located or resident in Wyoming and covered by policies in which such risks are in more than one state, and the payment of fines as civil penalties, where the obligation for the payment of such taxes has not been ascertained and the companies involved have not been requested to make the designated reports or pay the taxes.

             Credit quality, meaning the risk that invested assets supporting the reinsured business will decrease in value.

The records of any custodian through which an insurer holds securities in a clearing corporation, shall at all times show that the securities are held for the insurer and the accounts in which they are held.

      Where defendant insurance agent sold plaintiff insurance coverage for plaintiff's aircraft, defendant had a duty to see that the funds solicited from plaintiff were applied to the use for which they were secured. Having so failed, he must personally account for his actions, and failing to show reasonable exercise of such duty, his personal liability is established. He authored and executed the plan which led to his own misfortune, and he cannot be heard to complain that someone else, i.e., the corporations over which he had control, should be made to respond.

       Attorney fees in actions against unauthorized insurer.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any action against an unauthorized insurer, if the insurer fails for thirty (30) days after demand prior to the commencement of the action to make payment in accordance with the terms of the contract, and it appears to the court that the refusal is without reasonable cause, the court shall allow to the plaintiff a reasonable attorney fee and include that fee in any judgment that may be rendered in the action. The fee shall not be less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). Failure of an insurer to defend any such action is prima facie evidence that its failure to make payment was without reasonable cause.

     <p>
      The purpose of this act is to assure that health insurance benefits not subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act are contractually guaranteed, and to avoid the conflict of interest that occurs when the carrier responsible for providing benefits has discretionary authority to decide what benefits are due. This act is also intended to assure that health insurance benefits contracts subject to the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act which contain a discretionary clause provide appropriate disclosure of the clause and additional provisions to assure a fair determination of contract benefits. Nothing in this act shall be construed as imposing any requirement or duty on any person other than a health carrier.

     <p>
      The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public and policyholders against the effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates by promoting price competition among insurers. The provisions in this chapter are intended to prohibit unlawful price fixing agreements by or among insurers and to authorize essential cooperative activities among insurers in the rate making process and to regulate these activities to prohibit practices that tend to substantially lessen competition or create monopolies. This chapter shall be liberally interpreted to carry into effect the provisions of this section.

Ann. § 26-15-101(a)(ii) (2019) clearly and unambiguously provided that an insurance contract was “delivered” or “issued for delivery” in Wyoming if the policy issued was intended to protect an insured in Wyoming against risks in Wyoming.

This provision does not apply to surety bonds, or to specially rated inland marine risks, nor to policies, riders, endorsements or forms of unique character designed for and used with relation to insurance upon a particular subject, or which relate to the manner of distribution of benefits or to the reservation of rights and benefits under life or disability insurance policies and are used at the request of the individual policyholder, contract holder or certificate holder. As to forms for use in property, marine, other than wet marine and transportation insurance, casualty and surety insurance coverages, the filing required by this subsection may be made by advisory and rating organizations on behalf of their members and subscribers.

The commissioner may extend by not more than an additional forty-five (45) days the period within which he may affirmatively approve or disapprove any form, by giving notice to the insurer of the extension before expiration of the initial forty-five (45) day period.

     <p>
      A policy is assignable or not assignable as provided by its terms. Subject to its terms relating to assignability, any life or disability policy, under the terms of which the beneficiary may be changed upon the sole request of the insured or owner, may be assigned either by pledge or transfer of title, by an assignment executed by the insured or owner alone and delivered to the insurer, whether or not the pledgee or assignee is the insurer. The assignment entitles the insurer to deal with the assignee as the owner or pledgee of the policy in accordance with the terms of the assignment, until the insurer receives at its home office written notice of termination of the assignment or pledge, or written notice by or on behalf of some other person claiming some interest in the policy in conflict with the assignment.

        Rulemaking procedure. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission. Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committee in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard. The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.

A uniform standard shall become effective ninety (90) days after its promulgation by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine; provided, however, that a compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this article. “Opt out” shall be defined as any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in a promulgated uniform standard.

The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state which warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh:

Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of this compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently promulgated.

        Stay of uniform standard. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen (15) days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success. If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety (90) days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission; provided, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one (1) year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances which warrant a continuance of the stay, including, but not limited to, the existence of a legal challenge which prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission upon notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.

       There shall be a grace period of one (1) month, but not less than thirty (30) days, within which any stipulated payment to the insurer falling due after the first may be made, subject at the option of the insurer to an interest charge thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment. The contract shall continue in full force during the grace period. If a claim arises under the contract because of death prior to expiration of the grace period before the overdue payment to the insurer or the deferred payments of the current contract year, if any, are made, the amount of the payments, with interest on any overdue payments, may be deducted from any amount payable under the contract in settlement.

At the insurer’s option the contract may also except any provisions relative to benefits in case of disability and any provisions which grant insurance specifically against death by accident or accidental means.

       If the age or sex of any person upon whose life the contract is made is misstated, the amount payable or benefits accruing under the contract shall be in an amount as the stipulated payment to the insurer would purchase according to the correct age or sex. If the insurer overpays because of any such misstatement, the amount of overpayment with interest at the rate to be specified in the contract, but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum, may be charged against the current or next succeeding payment the insurer makes under the contract.

Any overdue stipulated payments and any indebtedness to the insurer on the contract shall be paid or reinstated with interest thereon at a rate to be specified in the contract but not exceeding six percent (6%) per annum payable annually. In applicable cases the insurer may also require evidence of insurability to its satisfaction.

      For contracts which do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time prior to maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid prior to the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, with the present value being calculated for the period prior to the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine the maturity value, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. For contracts which do not provide any death benefits prior to the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of the interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. The present value of a paid-up annuity benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.

     <p>
      If any individual insured under a group life insurance policy delivered in this state is entitled under the policy to have an individual life insurance policy issued to him without evidence of insurability, subject to making of application and payment of the first premium within the period specified in the policy, and if the individual is not given notice of the existence of that right at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration date of the period, the individual has an additional period within which to exercise the right, but nothing in this section continues any insurance beyond the period provided in the policy. This additional period shall expire fifteen (15) days immediately after the individual is given the notice, but no additional period shall extend beyond sixty (60) days immediately after the expiration date of the period provided in the policy. Written notice presented to the individual or mailed by the policyholder or the insurer to the individual’s last known address as furnished by the policyholder constitutes notice for the purpose of this section.

     Laws 2010, ch. 86, § 1, provides: “The legislature recognizes the need of individuals seeking medical and surgical health insurance coverage in this state to have the opportunity to choose among competitive medical and surgical health insurance plans that are affordable and flexible. Therefore, the legislature seeks to increase the competitive availability of medical and surgical health insurance coverage by allowing insurers authorized to engage in the business of insurance in this state who are also authorized to engage in the business of insurance in selected other states to issue individual medical and surgical health policies in Wyoming based upon their policy approval in the other selected states. In addition, the legislature seeks to initiate cooperation of like-minded states to create a multi-state consortium with reciprocity agreements for approval, offer, sale, rating, including medical underwriting, renewal and issuance of individual medical and surgical health insurance policies. By creating a consortium of states with reciprocity agreements, the larger population of several states with a single approval for sale in multiple states will be attractive to insurers to develop and rapidly introduce lower cost effective products to Wyoming residents.”

      Being deemed to be a policy holder for purposes of issuance of the policy is distinguishable from the involvement required to be a plan administrator. Baxter v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 982 F. Supp. 1453, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 18433 (D. Wyo. 1997).

Carriers or multiple employer welfare associations whose bylaws or charters do not permit them to issue coverage on a marketwide basis shall only be required to guarantee issue to those small employers which meet the requirements of the bylaws or charters.

    <p>
     Laws 2003, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, requests Congress to equalize the tax treatment of employer-provided and individually purchased health insurance by creating a tax credit for the full amount of insurance purchased by individuals since the high cost of health insurance has created a large number of uninsured citizens in the United States and the State, those without health insurance are less likely to receive adequate health care, insurance purchasing decisions are to a large extent made by employers and not insurance beneficiaries, overreliance on employer-provided health insurance impedes worker mobility, spiraling health care costs are in part caused by a lack of active consumer participation in health care markets, and employers can deduct the full cost of employee health insurance as a business expense, while individuals may not.

       Group health insurance conversion.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A group policy or certificate delivered or issued for delivery in this state which provides hospital, surgical or major medical expense insurance, or any combination of these coverages, on an expense incurred basis, but not a policy which provides benefits for specific diseases or for accidental injuries only, shall provide that an employee or member whose insurance under the group policy has been terminated for any reason and who has been continuously insured under the group policy, and under any group policy providing similar benefits which it replaces, for at least three (3) months immediately prior to termination, is entitled to have the insurer issue to him a policy of health insurance, referred to in this article as the converted policy. An employee or member is not entitled to have a converted policy issued to him if termination of his insurance under the group policy occurred because he failed to pay any required contribution, or any discontinued group coverage was replaced by similar group coverage within thirty-one (31) days from the date of discontinuation.

      This section shall apply if an insurer uses for underwriting purposes for insurance policies information from a report provided by, or database maintained by, an insurance support organization, or consumer reporting agency, related to the premises that is the subject of the application or to the person applying for insurance. Failure of the insurer, within forty-five (45) calendar days of issuing a binder, to act upon the information referenced in this section precludes the insurer from declining insurance coverage or terminating a binder of insurance coverage based on the information. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer may decline or terminate insurance coverage based on the condition of the premises as determined through a physical inspection of the premises. This section applies only to homeowner’s insurance and does not apply to a policy renewal.

       Obligation. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the legislature intended that the Wyoming Insurance Guaranty Association (WIGA) stand in the shoes of an insolvent insurer had it remained solvent, WIGA was only obligated to pay what an insurer would have paid had it remained solvent. Where a medical center would have been obligated to pay deductibles on claims paid by its insurer had it remained insolvent, it was not relieved of that obligation when WIGA assumed liability, even though a district court previously ruled that the medical center was not obligated to pay deductibles to its insolvent insurer. WIGA assumed the position of the insurer as if it had remained solvent and did not step into the shoes of the insurer in its insolvent status.

       The assessments of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year. Each member insurer shall be notified of the assessment not later than thirty (30) days before it is due. No member insurer shall be assessed in any year an amount greater than one percent (1%) of that member insurer’s net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year. If the maximum assessment, together with the other association assets, do not provide in any one (1) year an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments, the funds available shall be prorated and the unpaid portions shall be paid as soon thereafter as funds become available.

During the period of deferment, no dividends shall be paid to shareholders or policyholders. Deferred assessments shall be paid when the payment will not reduce capital or surplus below required minimums. The payments shall be refunded to those companies receiving larger assessments because of the deferment, or, if the company elects, credited against future assessments.

     Laws 2004, Sp. Sess., ch. 4, § 1, directs the Wyoming health care commission with assistance from the insurance commissioner to study the feasibility, costs and benefits of a new system to address and resolve health care errors and health care malpractice which study is to include: (1) definition and identification of health care errors; (2) identification of general and systemic causes of health care errors; (3) reporting of health care errors to a health care errors commission; (4) prevention of health care errors through systemic improvements that enhance patient safety; (5) a system to compensate individuals, as their exclusive remedy, for damages resulting from health care errors, including payment for all health care expenses arising from the error and other expenses and lost opportunities, including loss of actual and potential earnings, increased living expenses, decreased quality of life and other compensation as appropriate and as provided through a schedule or formula; and (6) prevention and elimination of unfounded allegations and unnecessary actions against health care providers in cases which do not amount to medical malpractice. In addition, the study is to ascertain (1) the probable costs of the system including but not limited to the costs of administration, improvements to the health care system needed to prevent future errors, compensating those persons injured by errors and to health care professionals in providing the financial resources necessary to support the system; (2) the size of the health care errors commission and the appropriate mix of health care professionals, attorneys and public representatives on the commission; (3) the administration and management of the commission including staffing and procedures for handling claims; (4) the schedules or formulas necessary to determine the compensation of people injured by health care errors; (5) the appropriate means for a person aggrieved by an action of the commission to seek judicial review; (6) an analysis of this system's costs and benefits for health care professionals, victims of health care errors and the public compared to the present system of tort; and (7) any other factors the health care commission deems relevant to the general topic. The health care commission is to report its findings under this section and recommendations for legislation to the joint appropriations, joint corporations, elections and political subdivisions, joint judiciary and joint labor, health and social services interim committees, a preliminary draft which is due on or before September 1, 2005 and the final report due on or before October 15, 2005.

    <p>
     Laws 2003, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, requests Congress to equalize the tax treatment of employer-provided and individually purchased health insurance by creating a tax credit for the full amount of insurance purchased by individuals since the high cost of health insurance has created a large number of uninsured citizens in the United States and the State, those without health insurance are less likely to receive adequate health care, insurance purchasing decisions are to a large extent made by employers and not insurance beneficiaries, overreliance on employer-provided health insurance impedes worker mobility, spiraling health care costs are in part caused by a lack of active consumer participation in health care markets, and employers can deduct the full cost of employee health insurance as a business expense, while individuals may not.

         “Long-term care insurance” means any insurance policy or rider advertised, marketed, offered or designed to provide coverage for not less than twelve (12) consecutive months for each covered person on an expense incurred, indemnity, prepaid or other basis, for one (1) or more necessary or medically necessary diagnostic, preventive, therapeutic, rehabilitative, maintenance or personal care services, provided in a setting other than an acute care unit of a hospital. The term includes group and individual annuities and life insurance policies or riders which provide directly or which supplement long-term care insurance. The term also includes a policy or rider which provides for payment of benefits based upon cognitive impairment or the loss of functional capacity. The term shall also include qualified long-term care contracts. Long-term care insurance may be issued by insurers, fraternal benefit societies, nonprofit health, hospital and medical service corporations, prepaid health plans, health maintenance organizations or any similar organization to the extent the entity is otherwise authorized to issue life or health insurance. Long-term care insurance shall not include any insurance policy which is offered primarily to provide basic Medicare supplement coverage, basic hospital expense coverage, basic medical-surgical expense coverage, hospital confinement indemnity coverage, major medical expense coverage, disability income or related asset protection coverage, accident only coverage, specified disease or specified accident coverage or limited benefit health coverage. With regard to life insurance, the term “long-term care insurance” does not include life insurance policies which accelerate the death benefit specifically for one (1) or more of the qualifying events of terminal illness, medical conditions requiring extraordinary medical intervention, or permanent institutional confinement, and which provide the option of a lump-sum payment for those benefits and in which neither the benefits nor the eligibility for the benefits is conditioned upon the receipt of long-term care.

      Any insurer which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than this state and is admitted to do business in this state for the purpose of writing insurance may become a domestic insurer by meeting the substantive requirements of law relative to the organization and licensing of a domestic insurer of the same type, by designating its principal place of business at a place in this state, and by receiving from the commissioner certification that it is a domestic insurer as if originally formed in the state. The domesticated insurer thereafter will be entitled to domestic certificates and licenses to transact business in this state, and shall be subject to the authority and jurisdiction of this state as a domestic insurer.

     Laws 2003, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1, requests Congress to equalize the tax treatment of employer-provided and individually purchased health insurance by creating a tax credit for the full amount of insurance purchased by individuals since the high cost of health insurance has created a large number of uninsured citizens in the United States and the State, those without health insurance are less likely to receive adequate health care, insurance purchasing decisions are to a large extent made by employers and not insurance beneficiaries, overreliance on employer-provided health insurance impedes worker mobility, spiraling health care costs are in part caused by a lack of active consumer participation in health care markets, and employers can deduct the full cost of employee health insurance as a business expense, while individuals may not.

       In cooperation with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, the commissioner shall identify one (1) group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group. The commissioner may determine that the commissioner is the appropriate group wide supervisor for an internationally active insurance group that conducts substantial insurance operations concentrated in Wyoming. However, the commissioner may acknowledge that a regulatory official from another jurisdiction is the appropriate group wide supervisor for the internationally active insurance group. The commissioner shall consider the following factors when making a determination or acknowledgment:
       <ol type="i">

      Any insurer failing, without just cause, to timely file the CGAD required by this act shall be required, after notice and hearing, to pay a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each day that the CGAD is not filed, to be recovered by the commissioner. The maximum penalty due under this section shall be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The commissioner may reduce the penalty if the insurer demonstrates to the commissioner that the imposition of the penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the insurer.
