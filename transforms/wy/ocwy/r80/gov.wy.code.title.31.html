        <p>
            Laws 1985, ch. 234, § 3, reads: “Any other act adopted by the Wyoming legislature during the same session in which this act is adopted shall be given precedence and shall prevail over the amendments in this act to the extent that such acts are in conflict
            with this act.”

        <p>
            No detailed explanation of the changes made by the 1984 and 1985 acts has been attempted, but, where appropriate, historical citations to former provisions have been added to corresponding sections, and annotations to cases decided under former provisions
            have been placed under comparable sections where it was felt they would be useful. For tables of revised and renumbered sections, see Volume 11 of the Wyoming Statutes Annotated.

                        The district court erred when it relied on the motor vehicle registration code rather than the Uniform Commercial Code (title 34.1) in determining whether a purchaser's claim was subject to the bank's prior lien and security interest. This chapter sets
                        out the procedure for noting a lien on a title but does not resolve priority claims; the Uniform Commercial Code governs priority questions. Franklin v. First Nat'l Bank, 848 P.2d 775, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 46</cite>                        (Wyo. 1993).

                        Ownership of a truck that was involved in an accident passed from an electric company's owner to a donee via an inter vivos gift in January 2008, and before appellant was injured in March 2008. Because the company no longer owned the truck and it was

                        to or an interest in a vehicle in such cases shall be furnished with the statement. If a transfer of title to a creditor is accomplished in accordance with the provisions of this subsection, a creditor retains the right to seek
                        any deficiency balance which may exist after sale, provided the creditor has complied with all applicable law, and the transfer by itself shall not be considered a strict foreclosure or an election to retain the collateral in satisfaction
                        of an obligation as provided by W.S. 34.1-9-620 and does not affect the debtor’s right to redeem the collateral under W.S. 34.1-9-623. If from the records of the county clerk there appears to be any lien on the vehicle which was
                        recorded prior to the lien of the creditor applying for title and which has not been released, the certificate of title shall contain a statement of the lien. The creditor repossessing and applying for title to the vehicle shall
                        notify all persons holding liens on the vehicle by certified mail return receipt requested at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing the application for title. Any proceeds from the sale, lease or other disposition of the vehicle
                        shall be distributed in accordance with the provisions of W.S. 34.1-9-608.

                        visible on a vehicle, and that the officer could properly stop the vehicle to investigate further. Thus, the investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle was justified by reasonable suspicion. Clay v. State, 2016 WY 55, 372 P.3d 195,

        Perfecting lien after bankruptcy petition. —

                    <p>
                        Bankruptcy court properly released a creditor's lien on a vehicle, where after bankruptcy court ordered return of the vehicle as well as its turnover, creditor attempted to note a lien on the title in the amount of $ 0.00, which was insufficient to satisfy
                        Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c02a08s31-2-801" target="_self">31-2-801</a></cite>, prompting the bankruptcy court to observe that the creditor made the notation “out of spite;” moreover,
                        the creditor did not seek relief from the automatic stay before attempting to note its lien, and, thus, it was proper for the bankruptcy court to prevent the creditor's attempt at perfecting its lien post-petition. Johnson v. Smith

                        by imprisonment for not more than six (6) months, a fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) nor more than one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00), or both. For a second or subsequent violation of this subsection,
                        the judge shall require the defendant to deliver the registration and license plates of the vehicle involved to the county treasurer for the county where the citation was issued, and the registration and license plates shall be
                        held by the county treasurer until such time as the judge determines that the defendant has met all obligations imposed by law. Excusable neglect or mistake by another is a defense for any violation of this subsection. If evidence
                        of excusable neglect or mistake by another is presented and the defendant is convicted, the court may consider this evidence in imposing a penalty under this subsection. The judge may suspend part or all of the sentence under this
                        subsection and place the defendant on probation subject to conditions imposed by the judge which shall include a condition that the defendant shall deliver the registration and license plates of the vehicle involved to the county
                        treasurer for the county where the citation was issued. This subsection does not apply to a vehicle owned by a nonresident and registered in a state requiring insurance if a vehicle insurance policy meeting requirements of the
                        laws and regulations of that state is in effect or unless it otherwise complies with the laws of that state concerning compulsory financial responsibility. The department shall report any violation of this subsection to the motor
                        vehicle administrator in the state wherein the vehicle is registered. A vehicle owned by a nonresident and registered in a state not requiring insurance is exempt from this subsection.

                        District court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress marijuana that a state trooper found in the vehicle defendant had been driving because: (1) the incident began as a consensual encounter between the trooper and defendant, as the trooper
                        stopped to render aid to defendant who was stuck in deep snow; (2) the trooper asked to see defendant's driver's license, which was wholly consistent with her duty as a police officer and did not invoke any constitutional protections;
                        (3) the trooper subsequently determined that defendant had been driving without a license or insurance; (4) defendant consented to the trooper's search of the vehicle for insurance documentation; and (5) once the trooper entered
                        the vehicle and smelled marijuana, she possessed the requisite probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband. Shaw v. State, 2009 WY 18, 201 P.3d 1108, <cite class="wy_code">2009 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite>                        (Wyo. 2009).

                        In a case involving two petitioners who were both convicted of driving under the influence, the Supreme Court concluded that Laramie, Wyo., Mun. Ordinance § 10.24.030(H) flouted the uniformly applicable statutes governing traffic regulations and was therefore
                        void. The City of Laramie had created a minimum mandatory jail sentence for blood alcohol content (BAC) results of 0.15% or more, which exceeded the minimum punishment for the same BAC level under Wyoming law. Wofford v. City of

                        In a case involving two petitioners who were both convicted of driving under the influence, the Supreme Court concluded that Laramie, Wyo., Mun. Ordinance § 10.24.030(H) flouted the uniformly applicable statutes governing traffic regulations and was therefore
                        void. The City of Laramie had created a minimum mandatory jail sentence for blood alcohol content (BAC) results of 0.15% or more, which exceeded the minimum punishment for the same BAC level under Wyoming law. Wofford v. City of

                        In an action for damages arising out of a collision between a loaded truck and an empty truck on a dirt road, it is proper to admit testimony that it is the custom, known to both drivers and previously adhered to by them, for the driver of an empty truck
                        to yield the right-of-way to the driver of a loaded truck so as to permit the loaded truck to proceed on the wrong side of the road in order to avoid holes or soft spots in the road. Such evidence is admissible, not to prove that
                        by virtue of custom a right-of-way was established contrary to the right-of-way given by statute, but because it is a circumstance having direct bearing on the question of negligence. McVicker v. Kuronen, 71 Wyo. 222, 256 P.2d

                        Substantial evidence supported the Office of Administrative Hearings' (OAH) decision to uphold the suspension of the driver's license for failing to submit to chemical testing pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c06s31-6-102" target="_self">31-6-102</a></cite>                        because: (1) the trooper stated that he saw the driver's vehicle cross over the center line and the fog line more than once; and (2) the OAH reviewed the DVD of the incident, which showed the vehicle drifting from one side of lane
                        to the other more than once and therefore corroborated the trooper's statements, even though it did not depict clearly whether the vehicle crossed over the lines due to its poor quality and limited duration. Taken together, the
                        trooper's report and the DVD constituted relevant evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that the trooper had probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation, namely driving under the influence or failing
                        to drive within the lanes. Tiernan v. State, DOT, 2011 WY 143, 262 P.3d 561, <cite class="wy_code">2011 Wyo. LEXIS 147</cite> (Wyo. 2011), overruled in part, Allgier v.

                        Defendant was not seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment when a trooper stopped him for following another vehicle too closely because the trooper developed reasonable suspicion that defendant was following a semi-truck too closely by using the two-second

                        that he saw defendants following a truck at less than one vehicle length behind, and there was nothing in the record warranting a conclusion that the district court's credibility determination or finding of probable cause was clearly
                        erroneous or contrary to law. Thus, the initial stop was reasonable and did not violate Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 4 or U.S. Const. amend. IV. Phelps v.

                        District court properly, on the jury verdict, found a driver not negligent in causing an automobile accident because, notwithstanding evidence that the driver failed to yield the right of way to the second driver, the jury could reasonably conclude from
                        the evidence that the first driver acted as an ordinary careful person would under the same or similar circumstances where the conflicting trial testimony permitted the jury to draw more than one reasonable inference, the evidence
                        showed that the first driver carefully approached the “T” intersection, took extra time to twice look left and right, proceeded slowly when he thought it was safe, and only collided with the second driver when the second driver

                        What constitutes reckless driving depends upon the particular circumstances, and the determination is for the trier of fact, whether it be the judge or a jury. Norfolk v. State, 360 P.2d 605, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 86</cite>                        (Wyo. 1961).

                        “Willful misconduct” implies at least the intentional doing of something either with a knowledge that serious injury is a probable (as distinguished from a possible) result, or the intentional doing of an act with a wanton and reckless disregard of its

                        It is not necessarily true that exceeding the speed limit will constitute reckless driving within the meaning of this section, since there might be an emergency or, if a driver wants to pass another car which is being driven slowly, it may be necessary
                        to exceed the speed limit for a short time in order not to endanger passengers in the car which is being passed. Norfolk v. State, 360 P.2d 605, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 86</cite> (Wyo. 1961).

                        to present sufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for reckless driving because it only presented evidence that he was driving while under the influence and crashed his vehicle into a tree. The testimony was sufficient for
                        a jury to make a reasonable inference that squealing tires, driving over curbs and into yards, and crashing into trees would likely only occur because the driver was driving in a way that disregarded the safety of other people

                        The surrender of a driver's license as a part of the penalty defined by the legislature for driving while intoxicated can be the function of the court imposing sentence, but the legislature has not seen fit to include suspension or revocation of drivers'
                        licenses as part of the criminal penalty. The provisions in former subsection (e), therefore, for the collection of a driver's license by the court and for the issuance of a temporary driver's license by the court are unconstitutional
                        in that they violate art. 2, § 1, Wyo. Const. by directing the exercise of powers properly belonging to the executive branch of the government to the judicial branch. State ex rel. Motor Vehicle Div. v. Holtz, 674 P.2d 732,

                        Substantial evidence supported the Office of Administrative Hearings' (OAH) decision to uphold the suspension of the driver's license for failing to submit to chemical testing pursuant to Wyo. Stat.

                        to the other more than once and therefore corroborated the trooper's statements, even though it did not depict clearly whether the vehicle crossed over the lines due to its poor quality and limited duration. Taken together, the
                        trooper's report and the DVD constituted relevant evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that the trooper had probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation, namely driving under the influence or failing
                        to drive within the lanes. Tiernan v. State, DOT, 2011 WY 143, 262 P.3d 561, <cite class="wy_code">2011 Wyo. LEXIS 147</cite> (Wyo. 2011), overruled in part, Allgier v.

                        Deputy had probable cause to stop appellant for failing to drive within a single lane of traffic as his report stated that appellant's truck went across the centerline and the fog line before regaining a single lane of travel; the lane violations were
                        also shown on a DVD. Because the deputy observed signs that appellant had been drinking alcohol and he failed sobriety tests, the deputy arrested appellant for driving while under the influence of alcohol; as a breath test that
                        showed appellant had an alcohol concentration of 0.17%, more than two times the legal limit allowed for driving, his license was suspended. Espinoza v. State ex rel. Wyo. DOT, 2012 WY 101, 280 P.3d 1226,

                        Drivers' licenses are not suspended at the time of conviction for driving while intoxicated by operation of law. The licenses are suspended or revoked by the division (now department). The principal objective of involving the courts in the suspension
                        and revocation procedure is to obtain immediate surrender of the license, but the division is intended to perform the function of suspension or revocation. State ex rel. Motor Vehicle Div. v. Holtz, 674 P.2d 732,

                        Driver's detention by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officers for driving while under the influence (DWUI) did not render his subsequent arrest by deputy sheriff unlawful because the driver could not have been arrested and prosecuted within the tribal
                        court system as he was not a tribal member, and he could not have been arrested by the BIA officer and prosecuted within the federal system because the DWUI offense was a State offense, he was therefore subject to arrest and prosecution
                        by the State. The BIA officer properly detained the driver for formal arrest by a state officer, and the deputy sheriff had the authority to enforce the DWUI and implied consent statutes. Colyer v. State, 2009 WY 43, 203 P.3d 1104,

                        The statutory requirement that the sentence to be imposed by the court for driving while intoxicated be more severe as the number of prior convictions of the defendant increases makes the statute a habitual criminal act. Before the sentence of a defendant

                        Wyoming's driving while under the influence enhancement provision does not restrict qualifying convictions to offenses that arise from violations of laws that are identical, or even substantially similar, to Wyoming's definition of driving while under

                        statutes which prohibit driving while under the influence in exactly the same fashion and to the same degree that Wyoming does. Spreeman v. State, 2012 WY 88, 278 P.3d 1159, <cite class="wy_code">2012 Wyo. LEXIS 93</cite>                        (Wyo. 2012).

                        Where there is a through street, the vehicle driver thereon has a right to assume the way is clear for his passage through intersections, whereas the driver of a vehicle on the nonthrough intersecting street is subjected to a new and added peril when
                        entering the intersection unless given warning of the superior right of the driver upon the through street in the use of the intersection. Fanning v.

                        A lane of traffic may be temporarily blocked in the course of highway maintenance work, or by an accident, and the effect on travelers becomes the same as a red light. Obviously, subsection (a) was not intended to require a driver of a motor vehicle to
                        leave his lane of traffic and give way to travelers from behind when forward progress is prevented by traffic being blocked. Reindal v. Casassa, 444 P.2d 321, <cite class="wy_code">1968 Wyo. LEXIS 189</cite>                        (Wyo. 1968).

                        It is clear that a foot or air brake on a bus is not sufficient to comply with this section. There must in addition to that be what is usually called an emergency brake.

                        A truck is required to have two separate sets of brakes, one of which is commonly called an emergency brake, to operate on the highway. Convoy Co. v. Dana, 359 P.2d 885, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 79</cite> (Wyo. 1961).

                        District court properly concluded a stop of defendant’s vehicle was justified because, despite the stop of the vehicle being pretextual due to information that defendant might be transporting controlled substances, a trooper observed multiple cracks in
                        the windshield on defendant’s vehicle, which could create impairment due to sun reflection, distortion, and damage to windshield wipers, where the trooper did not need to “determine that the driver’s view was impaired,” but only
                        needed “reasonable suspicion” to suspect the driver’s view was obstructed, obscured, or impaired. Simmons v. State, 2020 WY 132, 473 P.3d 1259, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 155</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

                        Trial court erred in dismissing a wrongful death action brought by mother against sheriff and county, on behalf of her son who was killed by an intoxicated driver; after determining that the intoxicated driver immediately intended to drive to follow an
                        ambulance to the hospital to be with an injured friend, the sheriff had a duty to do what an ordinarily prudent law enforcement officer would have done under like circumstances. Becker v. Mason, 2006 WY 143, 145 P.3d 1268,

                        This section does not apply retroactively to prohibit the introduction of seat belt evidence in a case where the failure to use the seat belts occurred before the current statute. Dellapenta v. Dellapenta, 838 P.2d 1153,

                        In a case where the introduction of seat belt evidence is not prohibited, the introduction of evidence of seat belt nonuse is allowed where an offer of proof is made to show a causal relationship between nonuse and injuries to the occupant. Dellapenta

                        against defendant, and therefore granted the plaintiff's motion in limine. The legislative intent of the provision was to bar the admission of evidence of nonuse of a safety belt in any civil action and in doing so, the legislature
                        impliedly advanced the substantive principle that seat belt nonuse could not be used to establish comparative fault; therefore, standing alone, § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c05a14s31-5-1402ol1f" target="_self">31-5-1402(f)</a></cite>                        has a nonprocedural purpose.

                were constitutionally afforded before its passage. State v. Chastain, 594 P.2d 458, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 416</cite> (Wyo. 1979), overruled, Olson v. State, 698 P.2d 107, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 471</cite>                (Wyo. 1985).

                        positions, all of which share one important common fact: they are state employees. However, if a federal officer is precluded from administering a breathalyzer test under this section to an individual who is arrested on federal
                        property, based on probable cause to believe that the individual was violating § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c05a02s31-5-233" target="_self">31-5-233</a></cite> by driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated, then it stands to
                        follow that no one could administer a breath test to that individual. This literal reading would lead to an absurd result; therefore, the federal airman officer could execute the breathalyzer test on federal property. United States

                        District court properly dismissed, for lack of a justiciable controversy, a driver’s request for a declaration that the state constitution precluded a law enforcement officer from statutorily deeming the driver’s consent to chemical testing because, while
                        the loss of driving privileges was a genuine, tangible, and existing interest, the officer did not “deem” the driver’s consent to breath testing, rather the driver “agreed” to take the test, therefore, a declaration would have
                        no effect on the admissibility of the breath sample that sustained the suspension of the driver’s license, the district court lacked the jurisdiction to consider the driver’s request for declaratory relief, and mootness was not

                        Driver's detention by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officers for driving while under the influence (DWUI) did not render his subsequent arrest by deputy sheriff unlawful because the driver could not have been arrested and prosecuted within the tribal
                        court system as he was not a tribal member, and he could not have been arrested by the BIA officer and prosecuted within the federal system because the DWUI offense was a State offense, he was therefore subject to arrest and prosecution
                        by the State. The BIA officer properly detained the driver for formal arrest by a state officer, and the deputy sheriff had the authority to enforce the DWUI and implied consent statutes. Colyer v. State, 2009 WY 43, 203 P.3d 1104,

                        Trooper had reasonable suspicion to detain the driver from the purpose of performing the field sobriety tests, and therefore the suspension of the driver's license was affirmed, because: (1) he smelled alcohol; (2) the driver admitted that he had been

                        Substantial evidence supported the Office of Administrative Hearings' (OAH) decision to uphold the suspension of the driver's license for failing to submit to chemical testing pursuant to Wyo.

                        to the other more than once and therefore corroborated the trooper's statements, even though it did not depict clearly whether the vehicle crossed over the lines due to its poor quality and limited duration. Taken together, the
                        trooper's report and the DVD constituted relevant evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that the trooper had probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation, namely driving under the influence or failing

                        Because a motorist's failure to provide a sufficient breath sample constituted an intentional refusal to perform an offered breath test for purposes of Wyoming's implied consent laws, the booking officer was not required to offer a blood or urine test
                        following the refusal. Faber v. State, 2009 WY 137, 220 P.3d 236, <cite class="wy_code">2009 Wyo. LEXIS 149</cite> (Wyo. 2009).

                        Substantial evidence supported a hearing examiner's finding that a motorist intentionally failed or refused to perform a breath test after the motorist was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Intentional failure constituted
                        a refusal to take the breath test, which refusal led to the statutory implied consent suspension of the motorist's driving privileges and the additional statutory disqualification from driving a commercial motor vehicle. Faber

                        Because there was substantial evidence in the record to sustain a conclusion that a driver was given complete implied consent advisements and that he was not misled about what his rights were under the implied consent laws, court refused to second-guess

                        In an administrative license suspension proceeding, the Office of Administrative Hearings and the district court correctly held that appellant was accurately advised of the consequences of refusing to submit to a chemical test under this section upon
                        her arrest for DUI; therefore, the officer's additional advisement that she could be prosecuted under a municipal ordinance for refusing to take a breath test did not trick or mislead appellant. Walters v. State ex rel. Wyo. DOT,

                        District court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of his blood alcohol concentration test because the affidavit in support of the search warrant was deficient since it contained bare conclusions; the judge issuing the warrant
                        was not provided with facts supporting the officer's conclusion that defendant was driving when the warrant was issued, and some of the underlying factual information supporting that conclusion was essential to support issuance

                        Although plaintiff's driver's license was lost while in the possession of the law enforcement agency and she was deprived of its use and possession until she retained a replacement license, at her cost, this did not constitute a deprivation of her due
                        process rights. The misplacement of her license constituted a “random and unauthorized” act for which no pre-deprivation process could have been contemplated. Therefore, post-deprivation process would have been constitutionally
                        adequate. Pogue v. Allison, 851 F. Supp. 1536, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6234 (D. Wyo. 1994).

                        Collateral estoppel did not bar the Office of Administrative Hearings from considering appellant’s blood alcohol content (BAC) test results in a driver’s license suspension proceeding because three of the four requirements for collateral estoppel to apply
                        had not been met. The issue was not decided in the prior criminal proceeding, there was no privity between the party against whom collateral estoppel was asserted and the party to the previous criminal litigation, and the party
                        against whom collateral estoppel was asserted had no opportunity to litigate the admissibility of the BAC test results in the criminal matter. Casiano v. State ex rel. Wyo. DOT, 2019 WY 16, 434 P.3d 116,

                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) had jurisdiction over a driver’s administrative license suspension proceeding where the driver did not challenge the constitutionality of a statute but only asserted that the law enforcement officer did not comply

                        of alcohol; (3) the driver admitted to having consumed several shots of whisky and some beer, the last of which he consumed only 15 minutes before the deputy arrived; (4) the driver was able to successfully perform only one of

                        a false name, refused to show the officer his driver's license, and refused a breath test; due to the probable cause determination, the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine did not bar evidence of appellant's arrest in his license

                    had arrested the driver set forth his observations of the driver, including: (1) the driver's pickup truck appeared to have run off the road; (2) the driver walked with a staggered gait, his speech was slurred, and his breath smelled
                    of alcohol; (3) the driver admitted to having consumed several shots of whisky and some beer, the last of which he consumed only 15 minutes before the deputy arrived; (4) the driver was able to successfully perform only one of five
                    field sobriety tests; and (5) the driver refused to submit to chemical testing. Bradshaw v. Wyo. DOT Drivers' License Div., 2006 WY 70, 135 P.3d 612, <cite class="wy_code">2006 Wyo. LEXIS 75</cite> (Wyo. 2006).

                    Substantial evidence supported a hearing examiner's finding that a motorist intentionally failed or refused to perform a breath test after the motorist was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Intentional failure constituted
                    a refusal to take the breath test, which refusal led to the statutory implied consent suspension of the motorist's driving privileges and the additional statutory disqualification from driving a commercial motor vehicle. Faber v. State,

                <p>
                    Driver's detention by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) officers for driving while under the influence (DWUI) did not render his subsequent arrest by deputy sheriff unlawful because the driver could not have been arrested and prosecuted within the tribal
                    court system as he was not a tribal member, and he could not have been arrested by the BIA officer and prosecuted within the federal system because the DWUI offense was a State offense, he was therefore subject to arrest and prosecution
                    by the State. The BIA officer properly detained the driver for formal arrest by a state officer, and the deputy sheriff had the authority to enforce the DWUI and implied consent statutes. Colyer v. State, 2009 WY 43, 203 P.3d 1104,

                        The division (now department) was not required to provide a hearing within 45 days of the receipt of the defendant's request, because the 45-day period could not begin to run before the division had sent notice and had received the defendant's request
                        for a hearing pursuant to that notice. The triggering event under this section is the giving of notice by the division (now department) of intent to suspend or revoke the license. State ex rel. Department of Revenue &amp; Taxation,

                        The limitations imposed on the department of transportation by subsection (f) circumscribe with equal force and effect the authority of a hearing examiner in contested case hearings, and a hearing examiner may not modify a suspension more than once within

                <p>
                    Every licensee shall have his driver’s license in his immediate possession at all times when driving a motor vehicle and shall display the license upon demand of any judicial officer, municipal court judge, any officer or agent of the division or any
                    police officer as defined in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c05a01s31-5-102ol1axxxiii" target="_self">31-5-102(a)(xxxiii)</a></cite>. However, no person charged with violating this section shall be convicted
                    if he produces in court a driver’s license previously issued to him and valid at the time of his arrest. For the purposes of this section “display” of a physical license means the surrender of the physical license to the demanding
                    officer. After examination the officer shall immediately return the license to the licensee except as provided in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c05a12s31-5-1205ol1k" target="_self">31-5-1205(k)</a></cite>. For purposes of this
                    section “display” of a digital driver’s license means that a licensee may provide access to the digital driver’s license on the licensee’s portable electronic device. No law enforcement or judicial officer demanding display of a licensee’s
                    digital driver’s license for any licensing or identification verification purpose shall take custody of the licensee’s portable electronic device. Display of a digital driver’s license shall not serve as consent to search the driver’s
                    portable electronic device. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a person, other than the department if it has chosen to issue a digital driver’s license, to accept a digital driver’s license or otherwise require the
                    purchase of equipment to verify the accuracy of a digital driver’s license.

                        District court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress marijuana that a state trooper found in the vehicle defendant had been driving because: (1) the incident began as a consensual encounter between the trooper and defendant, as the trooper
                        stopped to render aid to defendant who was stuck in deep snow; (2) the trooper asked to see defendant's driver's license, which was wholly consistent with her duty as a police officer and did not invoke any constitutional protections;
                        (3) the trooper subsequently determined that defendant had been driving without a license or insurance; (4) defendant consented to the trooper's search of the vehicle for insurance documentation; and (5) once the trooper entered
                        the vehicle and smelled marijuana, she possessed the requisite probable cause to search the vehicle for contraband. Shaw v. State, 2009 WY 18, 201 P.3d 1108, <cite class="wy_code">2009 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite>                        (Wyo. 2009).

                        Drivers' licenses are not suspended at the time of conviction for driving while intoxicated by operation of law. The licenses are suspended or revoked by the division. The principal objective of involving the courts in the suspension and revocation procedure
                        is to obtain immediate surrender of the license, but the division is intended to perform the function of suspension or revocation. State ex rel. Motor Vehicle Div. v.

                        The division can suspend or revoke drivers' licenses on the basis of prior convictions for driving while intoxicated other than those considered by the courts in imposing sentence. The courts can only consider those prior convictions referred to in the
                        complaint or information upon which the defendant is charged. Historically, the division has not been subject to the same restrictions as have the courts with reference to enhanced penalties under a habitual criminal act, such

                        Neither the division nor the courts can consider prior convictions for driving while intoxicated under the laws of other states or under municipal ordinances of this state in connection with sentences or with suspension or revocation of drivers' licenses.
                        Only convictions under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t31c05a02s31-5-233" target="_self">31-5-233</a></cite> can be counted as prior convictions for enhancement of sentences or for suspension and revocation

                        Substantial evidence supported a hearing examiner's finding that a motorist intentionally failed or refused to perform a breath test after the motorist was arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Intentional failure constituted
                        a refusal to take the breath test, which refusal led to the statutory implied consent suspension of the motorist's driving privileges and the additional statutory disqualification from driving a commercial motor vehicle. Faber

                        A review on the merits by a district court is proper in connection with the superintendent's (now division's) action in suspending a license. However, a determination in such a review that the superintendent's (now division's) action was unauthorized

                        The district court has jurisdiction to review on the merits the action of the superintendent (now division) in suspending a driver's license, registration certificate and license plates on the ground that the driver has been involved in an accident and
                        has failed to furnish proof of financial responsibility, where the driver in his petition alleges facts showing that he was not at fault in the accident, and that the driver of the other vehicle involved had stated that he did
                        not want damages and had promised to sign a release. Tavegia v. Bromley, 67 Wyo. 93, 214 P.2d 975, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 7</cite> (Wyo. 1950).

                        It is appropriate and reasonable for a state to require insurance or its equivalent as a condition for the issuance of a license, and it follows that it is all the more appropriate and reasonable for a state to allow a licensee to be his own insurer,
                        upon the condition that he is prepared to show financial responsibility or the equivalent of insurance when the need therefor arises by reason of an accident in connection with which a judgment might be obtained against the licensee.
                        And, of course, it is appropriate and reasonable for a license and registration to be suspended if the licensee fails to show such financial responsibility after an accident in connection with which a judgment might be obtained

                        The superintendent (now division) is not called upon to determine whether there is liability on the part of an owner before he can suspend his registrations. He (It) does, however, determine what security shall be sufficient to satisfy any judgment which

                        of the amount of security that should be required to satisfy any judgment or judgments which might be recovered, and, in so determining, consider the matter of culpability. This determination is based upon an interpretation of

                        The superintendent (now division) does not have a duty, in determining the amount of security deposit, to make judgments based upon conflicting evidence and to deal with such legal problems as contributory negligence, the application of the last clear
                        chance doctrine, and other intricate legal problems which can best be dealt with by the court. However, the superintendent (now division) should consider all of the facts presented to him (it) by way of accident reports, the reports
                        of investigating officers, and other evidence submitted to him (it), and where that evidence would indicate that there is a lack of culpability on the part of the driver or drivers, the superintendent (now division) should not,
                        under those conditions, suspend the operator's license or the automobile registration of the person or persons involved. Thornley v. Wyoming Highway Dep't, Motor Vehicle Div., 478 P.2d 600, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 189</cite>                        (Wyo. 1971).

                        It is appropriate and reasonable for a state to require insurance or its equivalent as a condition for the issuance of a license, and it follows that it is all the more appropriate and reasonable for a state to allow a licensee to be his own insurer,
                        upon the condition that he is prepared to show financial responsibility or the equivalent of insurance when the need therefor arises by reason of an accident in connection with which a judgment might be obtained against the licensee.
                        And, of course, it is appropriate and reasonable for a license and registration to be suspended if the licensee fails to show such financial responsibility after an accident in connection with which a judgment might be obtained
                        against him. Thornley v. Wyoming Highway Dep't, Motor Vehicle Div., 478 P.2d 600, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 189</cite> (Wyo. 1971).

                        Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for felony larceny because there was an intent to permanently deprive where defendant kept a vehicle for 3 months, lied about the owner of the truck, and made no effort to return the truck to the owner or advise
                        him of its location. Defendant argued that his actions constituted joyriding or unauthorized use. Peña v. State, 2013 WY 4, 294 P.3d 13, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 2013).

                    A manufacturer shall file with the department a copy of the delivery and preparation obligations required to be performed by a new vehicle dealer prior to the delivery of a new vehicle to a buyer. These delivery and preparation obligations constitute
                    the new vehicle dealer’s only responsibility for product liability as between the new vehicle dealer and the manufacturer, except for a loss caused by the new vehicle dealer’s failure to adhere to these obligations, a loss caused by
                    the new vehicle dealer’s negligent, reckless or intentional misconduct or loss caused by the new vehicle dealer’s modification of a product without manufacturer’s authorization. Any mechanical, body or parts defects arising from an
                    express or implied warranty of the manufacturer constitute the manufacturer’s product or warranty liability only as between the manufacturer and the new vehicle dealer. This section shall not affect the obligation of new vehicle dealers
                    to perform warranty repair, other service and maintenance as may be required by law or contract.

                        not subject to registration fees. State v. Union Pac. R.R., 823 P.2d 539, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 6</cite> (Wyo. 1992).

                    Before commencing business and annually thereafter, any person who engages in the business of renting rental vehicles in Wyoming shall apply to the department for a certificate or a renewal of a certificate to operate as a rental vehicle agency. A certificate
                    or renewal certificate is valid for one (1) year. Applications shall be accompanied by a fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and contain information with respect to the applicant’s name and established place of business address. The
                    applicant shall list the physical address of each location in Wyoming where vehicles will be rented or offered for rental without a driver. A rental vehicle agency certificate including certificate number will be printed for each location
                    with the physical address of that location indicated and shall be conspicuously displayed within the place of business for that location. Failure of the certificate holder to comply with any applicable rules and regulations or any
                    provisions of this chapter shall result in cancellation of the certificate and subject the certificate holder to other penalties as provided by law.
