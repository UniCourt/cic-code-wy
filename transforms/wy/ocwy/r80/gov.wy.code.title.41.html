     <p>
      A water right is a right
      to use the water of the state, when such use has been acquired by
      the beneficial application of water under the laws of the state relating
      thereto, and in conformity with the rules and regulations dependent
      thereon. Beneficial use shall be the basis, the measure and limit
      of the right to use water at all times, not exceeding the statutory
      limit except as provided by W.S.

      . In addition to any beneficial use specified by law or
      rule and regulation promulgated pursuant thereto, the use of water
      for the purpose of extracting heat therefrom is considered a beneficial
      use subject to prior rights. Water being always the property of the
      state, rights to its use shall attach to the land for irrigation,
      or to such other purposes or object for which acquired in accordance
      with the beneficial use made for which the right receives public recognition,
      under the law and the administration provided thereby. Water rights
      for the direct use of the natural unstored flow of any stream cannot
      be detached from the lands, place or purpose for which they are acquired,
      except as provided in W.S.

       Subject to governmental limitations, actual usability of waters is limit of public's right. —

     <p>
      This section indicates the legislature was aware that, without regard to their being navigable or nonnavigable in the federal sense or any other concept of navigability, its waters were usable for purposes other than irrigation, consumption, power or mining, and the waters might be used for transportation by flotation. So it would seem that subject to whatever statutory limitations may be imposed by the state on such use, or by the federal government when interstate or international rights are involved, the actual usability of the waters is alone the limit of the public's right to so employ them.

       When an owner of a water right wishes to change a water right from its present use to another use, or from the place of use under the existing right to a new place of use, he shall file a petition requesting permission to make such a change. The petition shall set forth all pertinent facts about the existing use and the proposed change in use, or, where a change in place of use is requested, all pertinent information about the existing place of use and the proposed place of use. The board may require that an advertised public hearing or hearings be held at the petitioner’s expense. The petitioner shall provide a transcript of the public hearing to the board. The change in use, or change in place of use, may be allowed, provided that the quantity of water transferred by the granting of the petition shall not exceed the amount of water historically diverted under the existing use, nor exceed the historic rate of diversion under the existing use, nor increase the historic amount consumptively used under the existing use, nor decrease the historic amount of return flow, nor in any manner injure other existing lawful appropriators.

      petition to change the place of use, point of diversion, and means of conveyance for water appropriations because the Board's decision was consistent with the law; as reduced, the transferred water right would not exceed the amount of water historically diverted under the existing use, nor exceed the historic rate of diversion under the existing use.

     <p>
      In a situation where the grantor of an irrigation water right sells to a grantee who intends to make the same use of the right, in circumstances where evidence of surplus and waste is not present and therefore there is no issue of beneficial and/or consumptive use, and in circumstances where there are no statutory inhibitions against the sale, the only limitation upon such a transfer of a water right from the land to which it was first applied is that it shall not injuriously affect the rights of other appropriators.

     </p>
     <p>
      For the purposes of transferring an irrigation water right, the concept of consumptive use has been consistently limited to the amount of water, less other contributing sources of water, which will result in the successful growing of a crop and, in a proper case, consideration should also be given to the amount of water lost by evaporation and seepage while the water is in transit from the headgate to the place of use.

This concept is not intended to permit the enlargement of a water right because the upper limit of a water right is that amount which has been adjudicated.

       The legislature finds, recognizes and declares that the transfer of water outside the boundaries of the state may have a significant impact on the water and other resources of the state. Further, this impact may differ substantially from that caused by uses of the water within the state. Therefore, all water being the property of the state and part of the natural resources of the state, it shall be controlled and managed by the state for the purposes of protecting, conserving and preserving to the state the maximum permanent beneficial use of the state’s waters.

       None of the water of the state either surface or underground may be appropriated, stored or diverted for use outside of the state or for use as a medium of transportation of mineral, chemical or other products to another state without the specific prior approval of the legislature. Provided, however, neither approval by the legislature nor compliance with the application procedures under subsections (m) through (r) of this section shall be required for appropriations that will transfer or use outside the state less than one thousand (1,000) acre-feet of water per year unless the applications are part of a collection of related applications or appropriations from the same source of supply for the same or similar use where the total use or transfer outside the state exceeds one thousand (1,000) acre-feet per year in aggregate.

The commissioner shall not in any other manner interfere with the headgates or division boxes, except as otherwise provided by law. The water commissioner shall keep a true and just account of the time spent by him in the discharge of his duties as defined in this section, and it shall be the duty of the water commissioner or division superintendent to present a bill of one-half (1/2) the expense so incurred to the reservoir owner, manager or lessee, and if the owner, manager, or lessee shall neglect for three (3) days, after the presentation of the bills of costs, to pay the costs, the costs shall be made a charge upon the reservoir and shall be collected as delinquent taxes until the complete payment of the bill of costs has been made. Costs recovered under this section shall be paid into the general fund.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The holder or owner of an adjudicated water right to the direct use of the natural unstored flow of any surface stream of the state may store such direct flow so long as no other Wyoming appropriator or user is injured or affected thereby. Prior to the commencement of the storage of water under a direct flow water right, the appropriator shall submit a request for such storage in writing to the state engineer and shall obtain the approval of the state board of control. The state board of control may permit storage at any time so long as there is no interference with existing water rights or uses. The state engineer is authorized and empowered to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary or desirable to enable him to effectively administer the provisions of this section.

      Prior to the enactment of this section in 1921, all water rights, including reservoir rights, were attached to the land and could not be diverted therefrom. The primary purpose of the legislature in enacting this section was to permit the diversion of reservoir rights from the land. The means to accomplish this purpose under this section is by deed.

      It does not purport to deal with third parties. A stranger to the transaction between the owner of a reservoir on the one hand and a landowner on the other, should not, ordinarily at least, be permitted to question the dealings between the latter, even though no deed was actually given for a reservoir.

      Conceding that the landowner may sever his reservoir rights from his own lands, yet if he fails to do so and conveys his land with its appurtenances without reserving his reservoir rights which are appurtenant to the land, and does not in fact convey such rights to someone else or put the reservoir to use on other lands, there is no sound reason why the reservoir rights should not pass with the conveyance of the land. It would seem that in such case there is an implied intention to that effect, since the statute requires that water should be put to a beneficial use. Sturgeon v. Brooks, 73 Wyo. 436, 281 P.2d 675,

The water user who may have used any water from such reservoir for any particular year shall have the preference as to the use of the same water for the next ensuing year. The state engineer, the water commissioner of the particular district and the water superintendent having jurisdiction over the region of any reservoir, shall together constitute a board of special commissioners, and shall have power, when application is made to them by either party interested, to establish reasonable maximum rates to be charged for the use of water from any reservoir, whether furnished by individuals or a corporation. The establishment of such rate shall be made only after notice given and public hearing had, at which hearing the applicants may produce witnesses and evidence, and such witnesses must be sworn and may be cross-examined. No commissioner shall sit upon such board and determine such rate who is employed by one (1) of the applicants or if the relationship of debtor or creditor exists between him and one (1) of the applicants. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to deny the right to store water for use for more than one (1) year.

      The board, subject to the restrictions applicable to all administrative agencies, has reasonable latitude and discretion in determining the rates, as well as the elements and factors upon which the rates would depend. The functions of the board as to the rates to be charged for the use of surplus water and the functions of the public service commission of Wyoming as to the rates of various public utilities are not dissimilar.

      Nothing in subsection (b) of this section specifically, or in title 41 generally, indicates that the legislature intended that the words “same source of supply” mean “same stream system.” Quite to the contrary, review of title 41 demonstrates that “stream system” and “source of supply” are terms of art employed by the legislature depending upon the result to be achieved.

      A contestant junior downstream reservoir appropriator possessed standing to bring partial abandonment under subsection (b) against a senior reservoir appropriator where the junior undertook to establish that his appropriation was “affected” (as contemplated by subsection (b)) by the senior's failure to apply water for beneficial use for the statutory period of time under facts which showed: (1) that the junior's existing water right had historically been unfulfilled by the stream flow, whether the senior diverted the contested water or not; but (2) that the undiverted flow of contested water has in the past served, and would in the future serve, to more nearly approximate the fulfillment of the reservoir authority of the junior. “Injury” to the contestant's water rights resulted from the ever-present danger and probability that the contestee would one day exercise its prerogative of “resuscitating” its abandoned reservoir water right by reapplication to beneficial use, thereby depriving the contestant's lawful utilization of the abandoned water.

In a case where notice by certified mail cannot be accomplished, an advertisement published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the forfeiture is alleged to have occurred, naming the parties in the case and setting forth the time, place, and purpose of the hearing, and a general description of the water rights whose status is under consideration, shall answer the requirements of notice. Notice by certified mail shall first be attempted before notice by advertisement is employed. Advertisement costs shall be paid by the state engineer. In addition, whenever it appears necessary for full and proper notice, the superintendent may post a notice of the hearing in a conspicuous place on the land or at the place where the water rights are attached or utilized, or on the point of diversion.

       Any use of a contested water right, easement, privilege, or portion thereof, by the water user, his lessees, agents, transferees or assignees on or after the date of the notice shall be inadmissible as evidence of beneficial use in all hearings or appeals arising out of the alleged forfeiture.

       A transcript shall be made of the hearing. The record shall be delivered to the superintendent. The state engineer shall provide and pay for the costs of such record. At the conclusion of the hearing, the transcript, all other evidence, and the report of the superintendent shall be transmitted to the board of control by the superintendent. At its next meeting, the board shall vote by secret written ballot to declare the right in question forfeited or to decline to do so. Any forfeiture requires three (3) affirmative votes by the board.

       Whenever the state engineer has initiated forfeiture proceedings, he shall not participate as a voting member of the board of control in any determination of whether any water right, easement, or privilege is to be forfeited, all other laws to the contrary notwithstanding.

       Any time within two (2) years after the date the board has entered an order forfeiting a water right, any person who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board by written petition, proof, or affidavits, that he was an owner, lessee or beneficiary of the forfeited right, that he had no actual or constructive notice of the forfeiture hearings, and that he has been damaged thereby, may require the board to reopen the case for a determination of whether such right shall remain forfeited or be reactivated without loss of priority.
      </li>
      <li id="t41c03a04s41-3-402ol1h">
       Whenever the board has declared any water right forfeited, it shall send a certified copy of the declaration to each contestee within sixty (60) days. Such party may within thirty (30) days after the date of mailing, appeal to the district court of the district wherein the hearing was originally held or in the district court of Laramie county.

      Where board adjudicated priorities on a stream and the tributary in separate proceedings, though appropriators on one stream were not parties to the action respecting the other, adjudications were sufficient to give power to the water commissioner to divide the water between the streams, though the proceedings were not binding on those not parties.

       Petition for exclusion of lands.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The owner or owners in fee of any lands constituting a portion of the district may file with the board a petition praying that such lands be excluded and taken from said district. Petitions shall describe the lands which the petitioners desire to have excluded. Such petition must be acknowledged in the same manner and form as required in case of a conveyance of land and be accompanied by a deposit of money sufficient to pay all costs of the exclusion proceedings. The secretary of the board shall cause a notice of filing of such petition to be published in the county in which said lands, or the major portion thereof, are located. The notice shall state the filing of such petition, the names of petitioners, descriptions of lands mentioned in said petition, and the prayer of said petitioners; and it shall notify all persons interested to appear at the office of said board at the time named in said notice, showing cause in writing, if any they have, why said petition should not be granted. The board at the time named in said notice, or at the time or times at which the hearing of said petition may be adjourned, shall proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto, presented, in writing, by any person showing cause as aforesaid, why the prayer of the petition should not be granted. The filing of such petition shall be deemed and taken as an assent by each and all such petitioners to the exclusion from the district of the lands mentioned in the petition, or any part thereof. The board, if they deem it not for the best interests of the district that the lands mentioned in the petition, or portion thereof, shall be excluded from the district, shall order that said petition be denied, but if they deem it for the best interest of the district that the lands mentioned in the petition, or some portion thereof, be excluded from the district, and if there are no outstanding bonds of the district, then the board may order the lands mentioned in the petition or some portion thereof, to be excluded from the district. Provided, further, that in case a contract has been made between the district and the United States or any agency thereof, no change shall be made in the boundaries of the district unless the secretary of the interior shall assent thereto in writing and such assent be filed with the board. Upon such assent, any lands excluded from the district shall upon order of the court be discharged from all liens in favor of the United States under the contract with the United States or under bonds deposited with its agents. Upon allowance of such petition, the board shall file a certified copy of the order of the board making such change with the clerk of the court and upon order of the court said lands shall be excluded from the district.

      The board may, in its discretion, at any time file a petition in the court, praying a judicial examination and determination of any power conferred hereby or by any amendment hereto or of any tax or assessment levied or of any act, proceeding or contract of the district, whether or not said contract shall have been executed, including proposed contracts for the acquisition, construction, maintenance and/or operation of works for the district. Such petition shall set forth the facts whereon the validity of such power, assessment, act, proceeding or contract is founded and shall be verified by the president of the board. Notice of the filing of said petition shall be given by the clerk of the court, under the seal thereof, stating in brief outline the contents of the petition and showing where a full copy of any contract or contracts, therein mentioned, may be examined. Said notice shall be served by publication in at least five (5) consecutive issues of a weekly newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the principal office of the district is located, and by posting the same in the office of the district at least thirty (30) days prior to the date fixed in said notice for the hearing on said petition. Any owner of property in the district or person interested in the contract or proposed contract may appear and demur to or answer said petition at any time prior to the date fixed for said hearing or within such further time as may be allowed by the court; and the petition shall be taken as confessed by all persons who fail so to appear. The said petition and notice shall be sufficient to give the court jurisdiction and upon hearing, the court shall examine into and determine all matters and things affecting the question submitted, shall make such findings, with reference thereto, and render such judgment and decree thereon as the case warrants. Costs may be divided or apportioned among the contesting parties in the discretion of the trial court. Review of the judgment of the court may be had as in other similar cases, except that such review must be applied for within thirty (30) days after the time of the rendition of such judgment, or within such additional time as may be allowed by the court within thirty (30) days. The Code of Civil Procedure [title 1] shall govern in matters of pleading and practice where not otherwise specified herein. The court shall disregard any error, irregularity or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

       After designation of an area as a control area by the board, the state engineer may temporarily adopt any of the corrective controls provided for by this section, where it appears that immediate regulation is required. After the well adjudication procedure has been completed, the state engineer may, on his own motion, and shall on the petition of twenty (20) appropriators or of one-tenth of the appropriators of water from a control area, cause a hearing to be held before the state engineer and the control area advisory board to determine whether the underground water in the area is adequate for the needs of all appropriators of underground water in such area. Public notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published once in a newspaper circulated in the area not more than thirty (30) days before the time set for the meeting. If the state engineer finds after the hearing, and after receiving the advice of the control area advisory board, that the underground water in the control area is insufficient for all of the appropriators, he may by order adopt one (1) or more of the following corrective controls:

      Pursuant to art. 8, § 2, Wyo. Const., and the statutes adopted by the Wyoming legislature, water rights are perfected by the filing of an application for a water permit which then is adjudicated to the applicant by the board of control after the board has determined that the applicant does have such a right by beneficial use. The right of a citizen of Wyoming to appropriate water for purposes of irrigation is defined and limited by these statutes. Each appropriator, in turn, takes his right subject to the right of any prior appropriators from the stream. Budd v. Bishop, 543 P.2d 368,

       Application for permit to acquire right to beneficial use of public water; duty of state engineer upon receipt; use for irrigation purposes; defective applications; corrections; cancellation; extensions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      On receipt of an application for a permit to acquire the right to the beneficial use of the public water of the state of Wyoming, which application shall be on a form prescribed or designated by the state engineer, it is the state engineer’s duty to date the application and to make a record of receipt of the application in his office. It is the state engineer’s duty to examine all applications to ascertain that they contain all the necessary information to show the location, nature and amount of the proposed beneficial use. If the proposed beneficial use is for irrigation purposes, the application shall give the total acreage to be irrigated and the acreage in each legal subdivision of land proposed to be irrigated. If, upon such examination, an application submitted in hard copy is found defective, it is the duty of the state engineer to return the application for correction, with reasons therefor, and the time allowed within which to make such corrections, which shall not be less than ninety (90) days, shall be endorsed on the application, or by correspondence accompanying the return of the application, and a record made thereof. A like record shall be kept of the date of the return of corrected applications, and of the date of the refusal and return of applications rejected. If the application is submitted in hard copy, the defective application shall be returned by United States postal service or by other generally accepted mail delivery method to the post-office address given by the applicant. If the application is submitted electronically, the defective application shall be returned electronically. If, at the expiration of the time allowed within which to make such corrections, the application has not been returned to the office of the state engineer with the corrections properly made, it is the duty of the state engineer to cancel the filing covered by the application. The state engineer, if in his opinion an extension is justified, or, upon request by the applicant for good cause shown, shall grant extensions of time for making corrections. However, extensions will not be granted if the request for the extension is received after the expiration of the time period the applicant seeks to extend.

       Appropriation of water seeping from canal. —

     </p>
     <p>
      Application for appropriation of waters seeping on to a farmer's land from a water association canal by means of drains erected by the farmer may be denied if the drain ditch tends to deplete waters being transported in the canal, but if the drain ditch gathers seepage which is uncaptured by the canal owner and which would naturally reach a stream, the water is appropriable as being a part of the stream to which it flows.

     </p>
     <p>
      A permit was properly granted to plaintiff for the appropriation of waters seeping from defendant water association's canal onto plaintiff's land; but any rights plaintiff secured thereby were subject, of course, to the right of defendant to terminate that source of the supply, which seeped directly from defendant's canal, and subject also to the rights of prior appropriators further down the stream, if they could prove that interception of the water materially damaged their prior rights. Plaintiff's right was, however, superior to any claims of subsequent appropriators. Bower v. Big Horn Canal Ass'n, 77 Wyo. 80, 307 P.2d 593,

       Time limits for completing construction work; extensions; forfeiture of rights; cancellation of permit; notice of date of expiration to appropriator.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the state engineer places his endorsement of approval on any application for a water permit, he shall require that actual construction work be completed within the time set by him in the permit. The time set for completion shall not exceed a period of five (5) years after the date of approval of application. In the case of an application for a ditch permit, he shall further require that the application of the water to beneficial use must be completed before the date which he shall specify, and which shall not be earlier than the date specified for the completion of construction; and that final proof of appropriation must be submitted within five (5) years after the date specified for the completion of the application of the water to beneficial use. He may limit the application to a less period of time for the completion of construction and application of water to beneficial use than is asked for in the application. For good cause shown, the state engineer may at any time, or from time to time, before the date of expiration, extend any or all of these periods. An extension of time for compliance with any of the specified requirements shall be construed to automatically extend for a like period the time for compliance with any of the specific requirements in relation to which the time expires thereafter. Default by the holder of the permit in any of the specified requirements shall work a forfeiture of the water right involved. The state engineer may upon such default cancel the permit. The state engineer shall, at least three (3) months before default in any of these requirements shall be operative, notify the permit holder when the time allowed will expire. Notification may be delivered by United States postal service, by other generally accepted mail delivery method to the post-office address given by the permit holder or by email or other electronic means that provides actual notice to the permit holder. If the permit holder cannot be reached mail or by email the state engineer shall notify the permit holder by certified mail to the permit holder's last known address and shall publish notice of the default on the state engineer's official website and for three (3) weeks in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, or in case there is no newspaper of general circulation published in the county, then in a newspaper published in the state of Wyoming and in general circulation in the county, the last publication to be at least two (2) months before cancellation of the permit.

      This section indicates the legislature was aware that, without regard to their being navigable or nonnavigable in the federal sense or any other concept of navigability, it waters were usable for purposes other than irrigation, consumption, power or mining, and the waters might be used for transportation by flotation. So it would seem that subject to whatever statutory limitations may be imposed by the state on such use or by the federal government when interstate or international rights are involved, the actual usability of the waters is alone the limit of the public's right to so employ them.

If restoration is not feasible and the effort or cost of maintaining the modified ditch or facility is increased, then the person is thereafter liable to the users for the amount of increased maintenance that results from the modifications.

The demand shall be delivered to the actor in person, or if the actor cannot be found then the demand shall be delivered conspicuously to the actor’s usual place of business or residence. If the actor fails to accomplish complete restoration or all the currently necessary maintenance within forty-eight (48) hours after the written demand is delivered in accordance with this subsection, the user may perform the restoration and may do the maintenance that is then necessary, as well as that which becomes necessary thereafter, and may recover the reasonable costs thereof from the actor.

The water commissioner shall take exclusive charge of the ditch or reservoir for the purpose of dividing the water in accordance with rights established by existing decrees, and continuing the work until the necessity shall cease to exist. In all cases where the water commissioner or a deputy water commissioner is called upon to divide the waters of a ditch or reservoir between appropriators, when the term of his employment exceeds three (3) consecutive days he shall be paid in full for his service by the interested water users in proportion to the established rights of each. Any payments not made for the service of the water commissioner after a written demand has been made for payment, the bill for the water commissioner’s services shall be a lien upon any land or other property owned by an interested water user refusing to pay and may be recovered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any reimbursement recovered under this section for services of the water commissioner shall be paid into the general fund.

      When a drainage or irrigation district is the plaintiff in any suit brought under the provisions hereof, it may join all owners of real estate covered by its tax sale certificates of purchase or tax deeds as defendants, whether jointly or separately interested in the real estate, or any part thereof, and may unite in such action any persons having or claiming to have any interest in the real estate described in the petition. The defendants may plead jointly or separately to the petition and the court shall try and determine all issues between the plaintiff and each and all of the defendants, and shall, in its decree, ascertain and determine the amount of taxes, interest and costs chargeable to each particular tract or lot of real estate, and state the name or names of all defendants who have an interest in each tract or lot of real estate upon which the lien is fixed by its decree. The fact that the owners of separate or different lots of real estate are joined as defendants in one (1) action shall not constitute a defense on the part of any one (1) or more of the defendants, or misjoinder of defendants, or causes of action, and like rights shall be extended to any assignee of said drainage or irrigation district, tax certificate or tax deeds.

      The taking of land for an irrigation ditch in the western states is generally regarded as for a public use, regardless of the number of acres or distinct tracts or farms to be irrigated or the number of independent owners, such taking being held permissible for the purpose of irrigating land owned by a single individual.

      This section permits the majority of the owners of the land in the district to file a petition whenever they desire to, (a) provide for the irrigation of the lands; (b) to improve the existing water supply for the lands; (c) to purchase, extend, operate, or maintain constructed irrigation works; or (d) to cooperate with the United States in certain respects under federal reclamation laws.

      It states that “provided that the benefit of the proposed work in each part will exceed the damages from costs of said proposed work in each part.” The word “damages” is hardly apropos.

     <p>
      The commissioners appointed as aforesaid, and their successors in office, shall, from the entry of such order of confirmation, constitute the corporate authority of said irrigation district, and shall exercise the functions conferred on them by law. They shall organize as a board, elect a president from their number and appoint a secretary-treasurer who may or may not be a member of the board. The board shall have power, and it shall be their duty, to adopt bylaws, manage and conduct the affairs and business of the district, make and execute all necessary contracts, employ such agents, attorneys, officers and employees as may be required, and prescribe their duties, establish equitable rules and regulations for the distribution and use of water to and upon the lands of the district; provided, always, that such rules shall not be in conflict with or contrary to any statute of this state relative to such matters; and generally to perform all such acts as shall be necessary to fully carry out the purposes of this article [chapter]. Said board shall have the power in addition to the means to supply water to said district proposed by the petition submitted for the formation of said district, to construct, acquire or purchase any and all canals, ditches, reservoirs, reservoir sites, water rights, rights of way, or other property necessary for the use of the district. In case of the purchase of any property by such district the bonds of the district hereinafter provided for may be used at their par value in payment without previous offer of such bonds for sale. For the purpose of acquiring control over government land within the district and complying with the provisions of the act of congress of August 11, 1916 [43 U.S.C. §§ 621 through 630], the board shall have authority to make such investigation, and based thereon, such representation and assurances to the secretary of the interior as may be requisite; and the board may contract with the United States for the construction, operation and maintenance of the necessary works for the delivery and distribution of water therefrom under the provisions of the federal reclamation act, and all acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto and the rules and regulations established thereunder, or for the assumption, as principal or guarantor of the indebtedness to the United States on account of district lands. The board may contract with the United States for a water supply under any act of congress providing for or permitting such contract and in case any contract has been or may thereafter be made with the United States as herein provided, bonds of the district may be deposited with the United States at ninety percent (90%) of their par value, to the amount to be paid by the district to the United States under any such contract, the interest on said bonds, if bearing interest, to be provided for by assessment and levy as in case of other bonds of the district and regularly paid to the United States to be applied as provided in such contract; and if bonds of the district are not so deposited it shall be the duty of the board to include as part of any levy or assessment provided for herein, an amount sufficient to meet each year all payments accruing under the terms of any such contract; and the board may accept on behalf of the district, appointment of the district as a fiscal agent of the United States, or authorization of the district by the United States to make collection of moneys for or on behalf of the United States, in connection with any federal reclamation project, whereupon the district shall be authorized to so act and to assume the duties and liabilities incident to such action, and the said board shall have full power to do any and all things required by the federal statutes now or hereafter enacted in connection therewith, and all things required by the rules and regulations now or that may hereafter be established by any department of the federal government in regard thereto. The board shall have the power to buy, develop, sell and distribute electrical energy as an incident to the ownership, control and operation of the irrigation works of the district or the cooperative works of the district and the United States and to use, sell and distribute the same. The said rules and regulations shall be printed in convenient form as soon as the same are adopted, for the distribution in the district; provided, however, that the commissioners of the district shall not contract with the United States for the construction, operation or maintenance of the necessary works for the delivery and distribution of water to district lands, or for the drainage of district lands, under the provisions of the federal reclamation act and any act or acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or the rules and regulations established thereunder, or for the assumption as principal or guarantor, of indebtedness to the United States on account of district lands, or for a water supply or drainage incident to irrigation under any act of congress providing for or permitting such contract, or for acceptance by the district of appointment or authorization as fiscal agent of the United States to make collections of moneys for or on behalf of the United States in connection with any federal reclamation project, until there has been an election duly held at which a majority of the qualified electors present and voting have voted in favor of making any such contract.

      A contract is not under our statute an idle ceremony. It must be approved by the commissioners and by the water users. It is intended for the direct purpose to lighten the economic burden of the water users as much as possible and to determine, at least in part, as to whether or not the project is feasible from an economic standpoint. It follows of course logically that to enable that to be done the district must first be organized. Gies v. Boehm, 78 Wyo. 449, 329 P.2d 807,

      In case the petition or proceedings are dismissed as provided herein, a judgment shall be entered against the petitioners and in favor of the commissioners for the costs, expenses, and liabilities incurred in said proceedings, for the benefit of those who have rendered services or advanced money in the prosecution of said proceedings, or have recovered costs on successful contests therein. Before any such judgment is entered, said commissioners shall file with the clerk of the district court, in which said proceedings were instituted, an itemized statement of such costs and expenses, duly verified, upon which an order shall issue, requiring said petitioners to show cause before said court, at a time and place named, why judgment should not be entered against said petitioners for the amount of said costs and expenses. Notice of the hearing on said order, to show cause, shall be given to said petitioners, by mailing to each a copy thereof, to their last known post office address, at least twenty (20) days prior to the time set for hearing, and by publication of the same in one (1) or more newspapers, published in the county, where the proceedings are pending, at least three (3) successive weeks prior to the day set for such hearing. Said motion need not contain an itemized statement of said account. All petitioners shall, among themselves, contribute in the payment of said judgment, in proportion to the number of acres of land they have within the boundaries of the proposed district at the time of filing said petition.

       Payment in installments; construction contracts with United States generally; default in payments as lien; exception; power of commissioners to enforce payment.

     </h3>
     <p>
      At the time of the confirmation of any assessment provided for in this article, it shall be competent for the court to order the same to be paid in installments of such amount and at such time as will be convenient for the accomplishment of the purposes for which such assessment was made, and the payment of the principal and interest of such notes or bonds of said district as the court shall grant authority to issue, such installments to become delinquent on the same date or dates as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become delinquent, and such installments shall draw interest from the date of any notes or bonds issued by the district and for the payment of which said assessments are pledged at such rates not to exceed seven percent (7%) per annum, as may be fixed by the court; provided, however, that it shall be competent for the court, in case a contract is made between the United States of America and an irrigation district for the construction or sale of irrigation works and water rights, to order the charges to be paid in accordance with the provisions of an act of congress approved December 5, 1924, entitled: “An act making appropriations to supply deficiencies in certain appropriations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1924, and prior fiscal years; to provide supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1925; and for other purposes,” and all acts that may be hereafter enacted as amendatory thereof or supplemental thereto, and in such installments as fixed by contract between the district and the United States. The annual levy for payment of construction charges on the basis herein authorized shall continue to be made each year against each tract of land in the district against which benefits under such contract with the United States have been apportioned, until the full amount apportioned against the same has been paid; such installments to become delinquent on the same date or dates as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become delinquent and such installments, after they become due, shall draw interest at six percent (6%) per annum. All assessments provided for in this article, together with all interest thereon and all penalties for default in payment of same, and all costs of collecting the same shall, from the date of the order of court confirming such assessments until paid, constitute a perpetual lien in an amount not in excess of the benefits severally assessed, upon all the land and other property against which such assessments shall be levied, superior to all liens of every kind and nature whatsoever except the paramount lien of the state for the general state, county, city, town or school taxes, and no sale of such property to enforce any general state, county, municipal, or school tax, or other lien shall extinguish the perpetual lien of such assessments; and such assessments shall also be a lien upon all equities or interests in existing water appropriations for the irrigation of said lands when the title to said lands is vested in the United States, and when said water appropriations have attached to said lands. The commissioner shall have the power to enforce payment of such assessments, and all assessments by them duly levied and confirmed, by shutting off the supply of water to any and all lands upon which assessments are due and unpaid, and may refuse to deliver water to such lands until such assessments are paid. Any person having an interest in land assessed for construction may at any time within thirty (30) days after the confirmation of said report, pay to the court the amount of the assessment against his land or any tract thereof. Said payment shall relieve said land and water rights from the lien of said assessments for the cost of construction; provided, however, that any district organized within a federal irrigation project for co-operation between such districts and the United States, may contract and agree in connection with the acquisition of irrigation works and water rights and the taking over of the care, operation and control of the same from the United States, that each tract or parcel of land shall pay the charges conformed in the assessments against such tract or parcel of land, and that liability for charges thus assessed may by contract be conformed and limited to the particular tract or parcel of land in question and if so contracted, shall not be imposed as a charge or incumbrance upon other parcels or tracts of land within the district.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each irrigation district, on or before the third Monday in July in each year to prepare an assessment roll of said district, which shall contain the name of the owner, together with a description of each lot, tract and easement of land within said district and the aggregate assessments of benefits confirmed by the court against the same; the name of all corporations assessed together with the aggregate assessment levied against such corporations respectively. The assessment roll shall also show the amount assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation in the district, for current expense and to meet the principal and interest on the indebtedness of the district for the current year. All such assessments to meet the principal and interest on the indebtedness of the district for the current year, shall be apportioned on the aggregate assessment of benefits last confirmed by the court. All such assessments for current expenses shall be based upon irrigable acreage and shall be uniform as to irrigable lands receiving the maximum apportionment of water from said district, and as to irrigable lands receiving less than such maximum apportionment such assessment shall bear the same proportion as the amount of water apportioned to such lands bears to the maximum apportionment of water to other lands in such district. Provided however, that the commissioners of any irrigation district may, in their discretion, provide for a minimum annual assessment for current expense. When such assessment roll is completed it shall be signed by the commissioners of said district, and verified by any one (1) of them. On or before the third Monday in July of each year the commissioners of the irrigation district shall deliver to the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district the assessment roll of such district. The county commissioners of said county, immediately upon the receipt of the assessment roll of such district and at the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, shall levy and assess against each lot, tract and easement of land and against each corporation, the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same on said assessment roll. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county, and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of such assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district, shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said districts.

      The only reasonable interpretation of the proviso contained in the 5th sentence of this section is that while the irrigable-acre-basis still remains the general guideline in the assessment of current expenses (as well as all other expenses connected with the operation of the district), the 1953 amendment which enacted the proviso gave to the district commissioners a discretion to fix some minimum charge that would be paid by all water users without such apportionment.

In advertising property for sale for delinquent taxes the county treasurer shall show in a separate column in such advertisement the amount of unpaid assessments levied against each lot, tract and easement of land in said district. The county treasurer of any county in which any portion of the land of any irrigation district is located, and at the time of advertising real property for sale for state and county taxes shall include in such advertisement the amount of delinquent irrigation district assessments against each lot, tract or easement of land. At the time and place of sale of real property for state and county taxes the county treasurer shall also separately sell the land for delinquent irrigation district assessments and shall issue separate certificates of sale therefor. In offering such real estate for sale for irrigation district assessments, the county treasurer shall offer the entire tract assessed, and the first bid received in an amount sufficient to pay such assessment, together with interest, penalty and costs, shall be accepted and the treasurer shall not attempt to secure a higher bid. In case no purchaser appears to purchase the land offered for sale for such delinquent assessments the county treasurer shall make an entry on his delinquent tax roll “sold to  . . . . .  District of  . . . . .  County, Wyoming”, and shall issue a certificate of purchase to such district. The owner of any tract, lot or easement of land in an irrigation district shall have the right to redeem the said land at any time within eighteen (18) months from the date of sale thereof by the county treasurer, as shown on said certificate by paying therefor the amount for which said land was sold by the county treasurer, together with such penalties and interest as may be provided by law relative to sales of land for delinquent state and county taxes, and in case the owner of any lot, tract or easement of land in any district shall fail to redeem said land from said sale for such assessment, the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the purchaser at said sale, his heirs or assigns. The irrigation district purchasing such land at said tax sale shall have all the rights of natural persons in regard to owning, holding and selling such certificate and including the receipt of a deed, holding the title to real estate and selling and disposing of the same. The commissioners shall in no case sell said land or certificate of purchase for an amount less than the amount for which said land was sold to said district, including interest thereon, unless authorized so to do by the court. The procedure for the issuing of tax deed, including the form of the deed, time of publication and service of notice of intention to apply for deed, shall be the same as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the issuances of tax deeds by the county treasurer upon the sale of land for state and county taxes, except as herein modified.

Notes or bonds shall be in a form, terms and denominations as may be fixed by the secretary of the interior in carrying out the provisions of the act of congress of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 388) and all acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or that may be hereafter enacted as amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or other acts of congress heretofore or hereafter enacted providing for or permitting the acceptance of the bonds, and which notes or bonds shall not be held to make the commissioners personally liable, but constitute a lien upon the assessments for the repayment of the principal and interest of the notes or bonds. In case any monies derived from bonds sold to pay for the construction, as herein provided, now or hereafter, remains on hand after the work is completed and paid for, and not raised for damages unpaid for, the residue may be used in the maintenance and repair, as in this chapter provided, before making assessment for maintenance and repair.

       Bonds; refunding procedures.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The court may, upon the petition of the commissioners, authorize them to refund a lawful indebtedness of the district now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by taking up and canceling all or a part of its outstanding notes and bonds, as fast as they come due or before, if the holders thereof will surrender the same, and issue in lieu thereof new notes or bonds of the district, payable in a time as the court deems proper, in an amount sufficient to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, together with an amount as the commissioners of the district deem necessary to provide for possible future defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, and bearing interest. For the purpose of providing funds to pay the refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in the district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may issue refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and may, if they desire to provide a fund to provide for possible defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, levy from year to year assessments against the land in the district for such purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.

     <p>
      The provisions of this article, relative to the levy and collection of payments, charges or assessments in irrigation districts shall not apply to any district which may be organized within a federal reclamation project for the purpose of cooperation between such district and the United States; provided, a different method for the levy and collection of payments, charges or assessments be agreed upon between such district and the United States; and they shall apply only with the modifications hereinafter set forth to an irrigation district which may have been organized within a federal reclamation project when the board of commissioners of such irrigation district by unanimous vote decide to make collection of their taxes or assessments through their own treasurer’s office. Whenever the board of commissioners of an irrigation district, organized within a United States reclamation project by unanimous vote of said board decide to make collection of their taxes and assessments through their own office, they shall certify their action to the board of county commissioners of each county in which their district is situated, by a written certificate, which shall be over the signatures of its president and secretary. Such certificate shall be filed in the office of the county clerk of such county not later than July first of the year in which the change of place of payment is desired to be effective and thereafter all taxes or assessments levied or assessed for such district shall be collected by, and payable to the treasurer of the irrigation district, at the office designated by such district at the time and in the manner now fixed by statute. When a certificate is filed as hereinbefore provided, then and thereafter the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district shall not be required to certify and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county or counties as otherwise provided by law, but shall certify and deliver said assessment roll to the treasurer of said district who shall act in lieu of and in place of the county treasurer in sending notices and collecting and receipting for such taxes or assessments. It shall be the duty of the treasurer of any irrigation district, following the method provided herein for collection of taxes or assessments to certify to the county treasurer of the county in which the land is situated the amount of any delinquent taxes or assessments on or before the 25th of May of each and every year and the county treasurer shall enter the same upon his delinquent tax list and make sale thereof as now provided by law. Any district which may or shall choose to make collection of its taxes or assessments as provided herein may revert back to the method of collection through the county treasurer’s office by filing with the county clerk of the county or counties within which such district is located, a certificate showing the desire of a majority of its board of commissioners to change. Thereupon beginning with the first of July of the year in which the change is desired to be made, all the requirements of collection through the county treasurer’s office shall be complied with.

All such assessments to meet the authorized expenditures of said district shall be apportioned among the various landowners owning lands within said irrigation district in such manner that each irrigable acre of land, as returned for assessment purposes by the county assessor, and as thereafter amended or confirmed by the county board of equalization, shall bear an equal part or portion of the total of said assessments as its assessed irrigable area, as returned by the county assessor, bears to the total irrigable area of land, returned by the county assessor, within said irrigation district. Such assessment roll of the district shall be signed by the commissioners thereof and verified by any one (1) of them. On or before the fourth Monday in May of each year the commissioners of any such irrigation district shall deliver to the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such irrigation district, the assessment roll of said district by filing the same in the office of the proper county clerk. The county commissioners of said county, acting as a board of equalization shall proceed to hear any and all complaints or objections thereto and correct, equalize and complete the same in such manner that said assessments listed in said assessment roll shall be equitably and ratably apportioned equally among the various irrigable lands included within said irrigation district. At the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, the county commissioners of said county shall levy and assess against each tract, lot and easement of land, the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same upon said assessment roll as revised and corrected by them. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of said county and in case the territory embraced in said district is located in two (2) or more counties, separate assessment rolls and proceedings shall be had and taken in each separate county, as required herein, but the assessment rate per irrigable acre as determined by the county commissioners having jurisdiction in the county in which the court proceedings are handled for said district shall be the rate per irrigable acre used by the county commissioners in all other counties in said district. Upon receipt of said assessment roll, the assessor of the county embracing any of the lands of said district shall extend upon the tax rolls of such county, the respective amounts levied against each lot, tract and easement of land as shown by said assessment roll of said district.

The petition shall state generally that the irrigation district was duly authorized, that due and lawful proceedings were taken to execute a contract with the United States which incurred a district indebtedness for construction charges to the United States in a maximum amount to be stated, and that the assessments to be levied against the individual tracts of land under the contract do not exceed the benefits to accrue to such tracts of land, respectively, by reason of such contract. The court shall, upon presentation of such a petition, fix a time for the hearing of said petition and shall order the clerk of the court to give and publish notice of the filing of the said petition, and of the time and place fixed for the hearing thereon. The notice of such hearing shall be published three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which such district is located and shall state the time and place fixed for the hearing of the petition, the prayer thereof, and that any person interested in the subject matter of the petition may, on or before three (3) days prior to the day fixed for the hearing thereof, answer or otherwise plead thereto, and no other notice shall be required to be given of the time and place of the hearing thereon. Upon the hearing on such proceedings, the court shall disregard every error, irregularity, or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of any party, and the court may make an order confirming and approving the proceedings taken to ratify and confirm such contract and the assessments for benefits and construction as required therein.

      Before any district shall enter into any contract for the construction, building, alteration, extension, or improvement of any irrigation works, power plant or system, or any part or section thereof for the use of the district, or for the purchase of any materials, machinery, or apparatus, such district shall cause estimates of the cost thereof to be made by some competent engineer or engineers and if such estimated cost shall exceed the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) no such contract shall be entered into for a price, cost or consideration exceeding such estimate nor without advertising for sealed bids. Prior to such advertisement, plans and specifications for the proposed construction work or materials shall be prepared and filed at the principal office or place of business of the district. Such advertisement shall be inserted for three (3) consecutive issues, with not less than twenty (20) days intervening between the first and last publication dates, in one (1) or more newspapers of general circulation in the district and, in the discretion of the board of directors of the district, in such additional newspapers or trade or technical periodicals as may be selected by the board in order to give proper notice of the receiving of bids. Such advertisement shall designate the nature of the construction work proposed to be done or materials proposed to be purchased; that the plans and specifications therefor may be inspected at the office of the district, giving the location thereof, and shall designate the time within which bids shall be filed and the date, hour and place the same shall be opened. The board of directors of the district, with the assistance of the state engineer, whose duty it shall be to supervise such lettings, may let the contract for such work or materials to the lowest responsible bidder, or, in the sole discretion of the board, all bids tendered may be rejected and readvertisement for bids made in the manner, form and time in this section provided. No such contract shall be valid nor shall any money of the district be expended thereunder unless advertisement and letting shall have been had as in this section provided. Such contract shall provide that wherever possible workmen who are citizens of Wyoming shall be employed by the contractor. All provisions of W.S.

      The Wyoming legislature has not in any sense abdicated to a wealthy few the ultimate authority over land management in that state. Laws 1961, ch. 215, authorizing the establishment of improvement districts was enacted by a legislature in which all of the state's electors had the unquestioned right to be fairly represented. Under the act, districts may be formed only as subdivisions of conservation districts. And a precondition to their formation referendum is a determination by a board of supervisors of the affected conservation district, popularly elected by both occupiers and owners of land within the district, that the watershed improvement district is both necessary and administratively practicable.

     <p>
      The votes cast in the referendum shall be counted by the polling officers at the close of the polls and a report of the results, along with the ballots, shall be delivered to the polling superintendent, who shall certify the results to the board of supervisors; and the board shall then consider and determine whether the operation of the district within the defined boundaries is administratively practicable and feasible. If the board of supervisors shall determine that the operation of the watershed improvement district is not administratively practicable and feasible, it shall record such determination and deny the petition. If the board of supervisors shall determine that the operation of the watershed improvement district is administratively practicable and feasible, it shall declare the watershed improvement district to be created; provided, however, that the board of supervisors shall not have authority to determine that the operation of the watershed improvement district is administratively practicable and feasible unless at least a majority of the votes cast in the referendum, which affirmative votes represent a majority of the acreage contained in the proposed watershed improvement district, favor creation of the watershed improvement district. Upon declaring the watershed improvement district to be created, the board of supervisors shall certify the fact of the creation of the district to the county clerk of the county or counties in which the district is situated, for recordation; and the watershed improvement district shall thereupon constitute a governmental subdivision of this state and public body corporate and politic. After being recorded, the certificate of the board of supervisors shall be filed with the secretary of state, and a copy thereof shall be filed with the state conservation commission.

Said payment shall relieve said lands from the lien of said assessment, and said corporation from all liability on said assessment. The clerk of said court shall collect no fees or commissions for collecting or disbursing such payments, and shall on demand of the commissioners of the district pay over to them all sums thus coming into his hands. Upon presentation to the state auditor of an order of the district court having jurisdiction of such drainage district, properly certified, the auditor shall draw his warrant on the treasurer on the common school account within the permanent land income fund in favor of the commissioners of such drainage district for the total amount that may be assessed against any lands included in such district, the title to which is in the state of Wyoming, and upon the payment of such warrants such lands shall thereby be relieved from the lien theretofore created for such costs of construction.

      Assessments to meet expenses of any current year of any district shall become due, payable and delinquent at such time or times each year as may be fixed by law for state and county taxes to become due, payable and delinquent. Commissioners having charge of any drain shall on or before the first Tuesday of June of each year file with the clerk of the court having jurisdiction of such district, a report showing an itemized estimate of the money to be raised by assessment within the district for the purpose of constructing new work, maintenance and to meet the yearly current expenses of the district. In addition to the amount above provided, the commissioners may add a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. Within thirty (30) days after filing such annual report, at a time and place to be fixed by the court or a judge thereof, the judge shall examine such report, hear all objections thereto, fix and determine the amount to be raised by assessments for the current year and cause such adjudication to be entered of record in said court and a certified copy thereof to be delivered to the commissioners of such district. The commissioners shall add thereto such amount as may be necessary to meet the principal and interest on lawful indebtedness of the district maturing during the current year, together with a sum which in their judgment shall be sufficient to provide for possible delinquencies. When thus completed it shall be known as “The budget of

      It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each drainage district, on or before the first Monday of August of each year to prepare an assessment roll of said district, which shall contain the name of the owner, if known, together with a description of each lot, tract and easement of land within said district, and the aggregate assessments of benefits confirmed by the court against the same; and the name of all corporations assessed, together with the aggregate assessment levied against such corporations respectively. The assessment roll shall also show the amount assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation in the district, for current expense and to meet the principal and interest on the indebtedness of the district for the current year. All such assessments shall be apportioned on the aggregate assessment of benefits last confirmed by the court. When such assessment roll is completed it shall be signed by the commissioners of said district and verified by any one of them. On or before the first Monday in August, of each year the commissioners of the drainage district shall deliver to the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such drainage district the assessment roll of such district. The county commissioners of said county immediately upon the receipt of the assessment roll of such district and at the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, shall levy and assess against each lot, tract and easement of land and against each corporation, the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same on said assessment roll. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county, and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of such assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said district.

The county treasurer of any county in which any portion of the land of any drainage district is located, and at the time of advertising real property for sale for state and county taxes shall include in such advertisement, the amount of delinquent drainage assessments against each lot, tract or easement of land. At the time and place of sale of real property for state and county taxes the county treasurer shall also separately sell the land for delinquent drainage district assessments and shall issue separate certificates of sale therefor. In offering such real estate for sale for drainage assessments the county treasurer shall offer the entire tract assessed and the first bid received in an amount sufficient to pay such assessment, together with interest, penalty and costs, shall be accepted and treasurer shall not attempt to secure a higher bid. In case no purchaser appears to purchase the land offered for sale for delinquent drainage assessments the treasurer shall make an entry on his delinquent tax roll “Sold to
      . . . . .
      Drainage District of
      . . . . .
      County, Wyoming” and shall issue a certificate of purchase to such district. The owner of any tract, lot or easement of land in a drainage district shall have the right to redeem the said land at any time within eighteen (18) months from the date of sale thereof by the county treasurer as shown on said certificate by paying therefor the amount for which said land was sold by the county treasurer, together with such penalties and interest as may be provided by law relative to sales of land for delinquent state and county taxes, and in case the owner of any lot, tract or easement of land in any district shall fail to redeem said land from said sale for drainage assessment, the county treasurer shall issue a deed therefor to the purchaser at said sale, his heirs or assigns. The drainage district purchasing such land at said sale shall have all the right of natural persons in regard to owning, holding and selling such certificate and including the receipt of a deed, holding the title to real estate and selling and disposing of the same. The commissioners shall in no case sell said land or certificate of purchase for an amount less than the amount for which said land was sold to said district, including interest thereon, unless authorized so to do by the court. The procedure for the issuing of the deed, including the form of the deed, time of publication and service of notice of intention to apply for deed, shall be the same as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the issuances of tax deeds by the county treasurer upon the sale of land for state and county taxes, except as herein modified.

The presumption shall be in favor of the regularity of such assessments, and they shall stand as valid assessments unless the owner of such land, or some interest therein shall show that said assessment is inequitable, or is void because the lands were not subject to assessment in the first instance.

      Constitutional provision against extinguishing obligations owned by state does not prevent sale of land purchased by drainage district for delinquent annual assessments for less than amount of accrued unpaid assessments, because bonds of district were owned by state, where sale price represented fair value of the land and was adequate to pay principal and interest due on bonded debt, but not accrued statutory interest thereon.

     <p>
      The court may, upon the petition of the commissioners, authorize them to refund any lawful indebtedness of the district now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by taking up and canceling all or a part of its outstanding notes and bonds, as fast as they become due or before, if the holders thereof will surrender the same, and issue in lieu thereof new notes or bonds of the district, payable in a time as the court deems proper, in an amount sufficient to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, together with an amount as the commissioners of the district deem necessary to provide for possible future defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments. For the purpose of providing funds to pay the refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in the district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may, if they deem it advisable, issue refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and may, if they desire to provide a fund to provide for possible defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, levy from year to year assessments against the land in the district for these purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.

If the owner is unknown or there shall be a contest in regard to the ownership of the lands, or the owner will not receive payment, or there exists a mortgage or other lien against the same, or the commissioners cannot for any other reason pay him, they may deposit the said damages with the clerk of the court, for the benefit of the owner, or parties interested, to be paid or distributed as the court shall direct, and such payment shall have the same effect as the tender to and acceptance of the damages awarded by the true owner of the land. This section shall not, however, prevent said commissioners, their agents, servants and employees going upon said lands to do any and all work found necessary prior to making their assessment of benefits and award of damages, and the trial on their report thereof.

      Whenever any incorporated town, city or village lies in whole or in part within the boundaries of any drainage district now organized, or which may hereafter be organized in the state of Wyoming, the commissioners of said district may enter into an agreement with said town, city or village under the terms of which said agreement, said town, city or village may agree to operate, maintain, repair or extend any drainage works lying wholly or in part within said town, city or village; and when such agreement has been entered into, said drainage district shall be relieved from the expense of operation, maintenance, extension or repairs of such drains except where any portion of the district discharges its water through the outlets diverted through said town, city or village in which case the drainage district shall assist in maintaining the said drain on a basis of land drained into said drain and said town, city or village and the individual freeholders within said town, city or village shall be relieved from the payment of assessments for operation, maintenance, repairs or extension levied by said drainage district during the life of said agreement. Such town, city or village shall thereafter levy each year, as a part of its assessment for city purposes, such amount as shall be found necessary to operate, maintain, extend or repair said drains in the same manner as is now provided for assessments for sewerage; provided, however, that any drain lying partly within said town, city or village and partly without may, by agreement between said commissioners by and with the consent of the bondholders and said town, city or village, be jointly maintained by the parties to such agreement.

      Where a landowner never actually received anything in the way of permits, fees, connections or service from a water district for which he did not pay, a mechanics' lien is a remedy that the district did not have available. Thus, the court should have dismissed the complaint for failure to assert the statutory mechanics' lien requirements necessary to vest jurisdiction in the court. Robbins v.

The board may ascertain and determine in a resolution authorizing the issuance of the bonds that the district has, or will have during the term of the bonds, or has and so will have, designated surplus and unpledged revenues derived from the operation of any income-producing project, or special assessments or excise tax or taxes which the district is herein authorized to levy, fix or charge, or from any combination thereof, and the board in said resolution may pledge all or a portion of such surplus and unpledged revenues as additional security for such payment of said bonds, and at its option may deposit such revenues in a fund created to pay the bonds or created to secure additionally their payment. Any such revenue pledged directly or as additional security for the payment of bonds of any one issue or series which revenues are not exclusively pledged therefor, may subsequently be pledged directly or as additional security for the payment of the bonds of one or more issues or series subsequently authorized. All bonds of the same issue or series shall, subject to the prior and superior rights of outstanding bonds, claims and other obligations, have a prior, paramount and superior lien on the revenues pledged for the payment of the bonds over and ahead of any other claims or obligations thereagainst subsequently incurred; provided, however, the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds may provide for the subsequent authorization of bonds or other obligations the lien for the payment of which on such revenues is on a parity with the lien thereon of the bonds therein authorized upon such conditions and subject to such limitations as said resolution may provide. All bonds not issued payable solely from such revenues or special assessments (with or without such additional security) shall be the general obligations of the district, and the full faith and credit of the district shall be pledged for the payment thereof.

All endorsements shall be placed on both the original and duplicate copies of all such maps filed to the end that the records in both states may be complete and identical.
