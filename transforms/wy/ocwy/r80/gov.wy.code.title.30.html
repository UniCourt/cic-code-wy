The committee will consist of 11 members, five of whom will be appointed by the governor, including two owners who own and occupy a surface estate underlain by leased oil or gas minerals, at least one of whom does not also own the mineral rights to the property, one owner of private mineral interests of a split estate, and two members representing oil or gas producers operating in Wyoming plus three members of the house of representatives and three members of the senate. State agencies must provide information and other support to the committee as requested. The legislative service office will staff the committee, which will meet as necessary and report to the joint judiciary interim committee its recommendations for statutory changes not later than November 1, 2004. The committee may request the presence of and hear testimony from any person relating to the subject of split estates, specifically including but not limited to representatives of the oil and gas industry, private landowners affected by split estates, private mineral estate owners affected by split estates, a state with an accommodation doctrine in its state laws, the banking industry and rural land appraisers.

      </p>
      <p>
       In the absence of a contrary statement by the legislature, the primary purpose of requiring mining claim location certificates to be recorded is the imparting of permanent constructive notice concerning the acts claimed to have been performed by the locator. Globe Mining Co. v. Anderson, 78 Wyo. 17, 318 P.2d 373, <cite class="wy_code">1957 Wyo. LEXIS 34</cite> (Wyo. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       The location certificates on record take the place of the location notices, rendering proof of the posting of the notices unnecessary as against adverse claimants. The purpose to be thus served would seem to be predicated upon the possibility that the boundary markers, just as the posted notice, may very likely be lost or destroyed on the ground. Under such circumstances, constructive notice is provided by the location certificate to be recorded in accordance with this section. Rasmussen Drilling, Inc. v.

       The provision of this section that the “width of any lode claim located within Wyoming shall not exceed three hundred (300) feet on each side of the discovery shaft, the discovery shaft being always equally distant from the sidelines of the claims,” means that in no instance may a claim extend to more than 300 feet from the center point between the sidelines. A deviation of the discovery shaft from the original center point cannot alter the position of the sideline closest thereto, but automatically delimits the position of the other sideline to a point “equally distant” from the discovery shaft.

       This section embodies the legislative public policy determination that contract provisions indemnifying against loss or liability resulting from one's own negligence in an agreement pertaining to wells for oil, gas or water, or mines for minerals, shall be void and unenforceable.

       Statute did not render the insurer's two insurance policies covering the insured a nullity so that any coverage was more illusory than real and any liability had to be the insured's alone; while indemnity agreements were generally impermissible, insurance contracts supplied an exception to the rule, and the Wyoming legislature expressly allowed the enforcement of any insurance contract.

       One who digs pits to collect waste fluids from a fire at an oil and gas separation plant is not “rendering services” in connection with an oil well. This is true even if the separation plant processes gas which is eventually reinjected into the oil field to repressurize oil wells. Reliance Ins. Co. v.

       The main purpose of this statute is to make definite, or perhaps to enlarge, the employer's common-law duty to maintain its haulage-way in safe condition for workmen who, while acting within scope of employment, have occasion to be there. Hamilton v. Swigart Coal Mine, 59 Wyo. 485, 143 P.2d 203, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1943) (construing former § 57-408, W.C.S. 1945).

       Although the coal mine operator failed to provide holes for shelter and did not provide a 22-inch clearance as required by a former statute, it was not liable for the death of a miner resulting from the employee's violation of the employer's rule against entering the haulage-way. Hamilton v. Swigart Coal Mine, 59 Wyo. 485, 143 P.2d 203, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1943) (construing former §§ 57-408 and 57-415, W.C.S. 1945).

         The effects of mining on the availability of land, water and other resources for other uses present special problems which properly can be approached only with due consideration for the rights and interests of those engaged in mining, those using or proposing to use these resources for other purposes, and the public;

         Such variables as soil structure and composition, physiography, climatic conditions, and the needs of the public make impracticable the application to all mining areas of a single standard for the conservation, adaptation, or restoration of mined land, or the development of mineral and other natural resources; but justifiable requirements of law and practice relating to the effects of mining on lands, water, and other resources may be reduced in equity or effectiveness unless they pertain similarly from state to state for all mining operations similarly situated;

         Assist the party states in their efforts to facilitate the use of land and other resources affected by mining, so that such use may be consistent with sound land use, public health, and public safety, and to this end to study and recommend, wherever desirable, techniques for the improvement, restoration or protection of such land and other resources;

    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose of the Oil and Gas Conservation Act is to provide a comprehensive regulatory program which prevents the waste of Wyoming's oil and gas resources and protects the correlative rights of property owners. The act, therefore, represents a legislative modification to the rule of capture. Union Pac. Resources Co. v. Texaco, 882 P.2d 212, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 111</cite> (Wyo. 1994), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 143</cite> (Wyo. Nov. 1, 1994).

       The department of revenue, acting through the state board of equalization, is vested with pervasive and sole authority over all aspects of the taxation of Wyoming citizens and business entities, including the construction of any statute affecting the assessment, levying, and collection of taxes; the oil and gas commission is empowered to adopt rules and regulations and act administratively to prevent waste and encourage the conservation of Wyoming's oil and gas resources.

       The oil and gas conservation commission must make its decisions and promulgate its orders by its discerning conclusions as to what will either prevent or remediate waste; the commission has no authority to base its decisions on tax matters. Kerr-Mcgee Corp. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 903 P.2d 537, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 186</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

       Correlative rights and right to produce oil from pool are limited
   
   by a duty not to injure the pool and cause waste. Gilmore v. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 642 P.2d 773, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1982); Trout v.

      <p>
       The correlative rights granted by these provisions are limited. That is, although the owner of each property in a pool has the right to produce its equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool, that right is always subject to the need to prevent waste. Big Piney Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 715 P.2d 557, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 507</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

       Wyo. Oil and Gas Conservation Commission's findings of fact in
   its decision allowing a junior gas producer to inject leftover carbon
   dioxide into a geologic formation were inadequate; the decision did
   not outline the facts on which it relied to resolve the senior producer's
   contention that the plan would cause waste and compromise its correlative

       The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive regulatory program which prevents the waste of Wyoming's oil and gas resources and protects the correlative rights of property owners. Anschutz Corp. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 923 P.2d 751, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 130</cite> (Wyo. 1996).

       Correlative rights and right to produce oil from pool are limited
   
   by a duty not to injure the pool and cause waste. Gilmore v. Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 642 P.2d 773, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1982).

      </p>
      <p>
       The correlative rights granted by these provisions are limited. That is, although the owner of each property in a pool has the right to produce its equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool, that right is always subject to the need to prevent waste.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the powers and authority, either express or implied, granted to the Wyoming oil and gas conservation commission by virtue of the statutes of the state of Wyoming, the commission is hereby authorized and empowered in prescribing its rules of order or procedure in connection with hearings or other proceedings before the commission to provide for the appointment of one (1) or more examiners to conduct a hearing or hearings with respect to any matter properly coming before the commission and to make reports and recommendations to the commission with respect thereto. Any member of the commission, or its staff or any other person designated by the commission may serve as an examiner. The commission may also provide for additional compensation to be paid to a member of the commission appointed from the public at large or any other person designated by the commission for services performed as an examiner at the same rate as the at-large members of the commission are presently compensated. The commission shall promulgate rules and regulations with regard to hearings to be conducted before examiners which shall provide for rehearing before the commission, upon the request of any interested party, of any matter heard before an examiner. The commission may enter orders based upon the reports and recommendations of its examiners. If such an order grants the request of an applicant, and no objection to the granting thereof has been filed or made before or during the hearing before the examiner, said order shall become effective immediately. If such an order denies the request of the applicant, in whole or in part, or if a timely protest to the granting of an application is filed or made, said order shall not become effective until: (a) the time prescribed by rule for the making of a request for rehearing before the commission has expired without any such request having been made or (b) all interested parties have waived their right to request a rehearing, or (c) if timely request for rehearing is made, the commission after rehearing, shall affirm, revoke or modify such order. After an order based upon a hearing conducted by an examiner has become effective, it shall have the same force and effect as if said hearing had been conducted before the members of said commission.

       Energy company’s bond forfeiture complaint against the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (Commission) was properly dismissed because (1) the company’s only recourse was to timely file a petition for review with a district court within 30 days of the Commission’s order, as the company’s complaint was outside the scope of the statute permitting declaratory judgment complaints in limited circumstances, (2) that statute was not expressly or impliedly repealed, and (3) the company’s complaint was untimely, leaving the district court without jurisdiction.

Provided that in addition to any other notice required by W.S. 30-5-111(d) as amended, or any other provision of law or the commission’s rules, the commission shall cause notice of any hearing before it on an application for such exception to be mailed by registered or certified mail with return receipt to each of the owners specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection at least ten (10) days before the date of such hearing.

Each such pooling order shall be made after notice and hearing and shall be upon terms and conditions that are just and reasonable. Operations incident to the drilling of a well upon any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed for all purposes to be the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit by the several owners thereof. That portion of the production allocated or applicable to each tract included in a unit covered by a pooling order shall, when produced, be deemed for all purposes to have been produced from such tract by a well drilled thereon. A pooling order issued under this subsection shall expire twelve (12) months after issuance if the person authorized to drill and operate a well fails to commence operations within twelve (12) months of issuance of the pooling order.

The commission is specifically authorized to provide that the owner or owners drilling or paying for the drilling or for the operation of a well for the benefit of all owners shall be entitled to all production from the well which would be received by the owner or owners, for whose benefit the well was drilled or operated, after payment of royalty as provided in the lease, if any, applicable to each tract or interest or after payment of the royalty if required under subsection (h) of this section, and obligations payable out of production, until the owner or owners drilling or operating the well or both have been paid the amount due under the terms of the pooling order or order settling the dispute. In the event of any disputed cost, the commission shall determine the proper cost. The order shall determine the interest of each owner in the unit, and may provide that each owner who agrees with the person or persons drilling and operating the well for the payment by the owner of his share of the costs, unless he has agreed otherwise, shall be entitled to receive, subject to royalty or similar obligations, the share of the production of the well applicable to the tract of the nonconsenting owner. Each owner who does not agree, shall be entitled to receive from the person or persons drilling and operating the well on the unit his share of the production applicable to his interest after the person or persons drilling and operating the well have recovered the following, subject to the provisions of subsection (h) of this section:

       The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive regulatory program which prevents the waste of Wyoming's oil and gas resources and protects the correlative rights of property owners. Anschutz Corp. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 923 P.2d 751, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 130</cite> (Wyo. 1996).

      <p>
       Initially, the design and purpose of this chapter was to prevent “waste”
   
   in the production of oil and gas, and one of the means selected for accomplishment of that purpose was the granting of authority to the oil and gas conservation commission to establish, after hearing, “drilling units of specified and approximately uniform shape [now size] covering any pool.” Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 446 P.2d 550, <cite class="wy_code">1968 Wyo. LEXIS 209</cite> (Wyo. 1968).

        Commission's power to create drilling unit and order poolingof all interests. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The state oil and gas conservation commission had the right to create a drilling unit in order to prevent or assist in the prevention of waste or to protect correlative rights and, subsequent to the establishment of a drilling unit, to order pooling of all interests, including royalty interests. Mitchell v. Simpson, 493 P.2d 399, <cite class="wy_code">1972 Wyo. LEXIS 221</cite> (Wyo. 1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       The oil and gas conservation commission has broad authority to establish drilling units to prevent or assist in the prevention of waste or to protect correlative rights, and once a drilling unit is established the commission has continuing authority to modify its orders to ensure that the drilling unit is not smaller than the maximum area that can be efficiently drained by one well.

      <p>
       Because the legislature authorized the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to decrease the size of a drilling unit to prevent waste and protect correlative rights, if the commission determines it is necessary to increase the size of a particular drilling unit to prevent waste or to protect correlative rights, the commission has continuing authority to modify its previous orders. Therefore, an order from the commission can supersede some terms of a parties' contract in a reasonable exercise of the police power. Union Pac. Resources Co. v.

Whenever the commission enters an order providing for a unit operation, any lease, other than a state or federal lease, which covers lands that are in part within the unit area embraced in any such plan of unitization and that are in part outside of such unit area shall be vertically segregated into separate leases, one (1) covering all formations underlying the lands within such unit area and the other covering all formations underlying the lands outside each unit area, such segregation to be effective as of the anniversary date of such lease next ensuing after the expiration of ninety (90) days from the effective date of unitization; provided, however, that any such segregated lease as to the outside lands shall continue in force and effect for the primary term thereof, but not for less than two (2) years from the date of such segregation and so long thereafter as operations are conducted under the provisions of the lease. If any such lease provides for a lump-sum rental and if rentals become payable under any segregated lease covering the outside land, such lump-sum rental shall be prorated between such segregated leases on an acreage basis.

The lien may be established and enforced in the same manner as provided by W.S. 29-3-101 through 29-3-111. For such purposes any nonconsenting owner shall be deemed to have contracted with the unit operator for his proportionate part of the cost of developing and operating the unit area. A transfer or conversion of any owner’s interest or any portion thereof however accomplished after the effective date of the order creating the unit, shall not relieve the transferred interest of said operator’s lien on said interest for the cost and expense of unit operations.

No person shall be excused from attending and testifying, or from producing books, papers, and records before the commission or a court, or from obedience to the subpoena of the commission or a court, on the ground or for reason that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture; provided, that nothing herein contained shall be construed as requiring any person to produce any books, papers, or records, or to testify in response to any inquiry not pertinent to some question lawfully before the commission or court for determination. No natural person shall be subjected to criminal prosecution or to any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which, in spite of his objection, he may be required to testify or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the commission or court, or in obedience to a subpoena; provided, that no person testifying shall be exempted from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.

Any person so damaged by the violation may sue for and recover such damages as he otherwise may be entitled to receive. In the event the commission shall fail to bring suit to enjoin any actual or threatened violation of this act, or of any rule, regulation or order made hereunder, then any person or party in interest adversely affected and who has notified the commission in writing of such violation or threat thereof and has requested the commission to sue, may, to prevent any or further violation, bring suit for that purpose in the district court of any county in which the commission could have brought suit.

       Energy company’s bond forfeiture complaint against the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (Commission) was properly dismissed because (1) the company’s only recourse was to timely file a petition for review with a district court within 30 days of the Commission’s order, as the company’s complaint was outside the scope of the statute permitting declaratory judgment complaints in limited circumstances, (2) that statute was not expressly or impliedly repealed, and (3) the company’s complaint was untimely, leaving the district court without jurisdiction.

The commission shall by order fix the amount of the charge in the first instance and may reduce or increase the amount as the expenses chargeable may require. The amounts fixed by the commission shall not exceed the limit prescribed above. It is the duty of the commission to collect all assessments. All monies collected shall be remitted to the state treasurer for deposit in a separate account and used exclusively to pay the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the administration and enforcement of W.S. 30-5-101 through 30-5-119.

The charge so assessed is payable monthly. The sum due is payable to the commission, on or before the twenty-fifth of the second month following the month in which the charge accrued by the producer on behalf of himself and all other interested persons. If there is a sale of oil or gas within this state the charge is payable by the purchaser. Any charge not paid within the time specified bears interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month from the date of delinquency until paid. This charge together with the interest is a lien upon the oil or gas against which it is levied and assessed.

     <p>
      The state of Wyoming being a sovereign state and not disposed to jeopardize or surrender any of its sovereign rights, this act shall apply to all lands in the state of Wyoming lawfully subject to its police powers; provided, it shall apply to lands of the United States or to lands subject to the jurisdiction of the United States only to the extent that control and supervision of conservation of oil and gas by the United States on its lands shall fail to effect the intent and purposes of this act and otherwise shall apply to such lands to such extent as an officer of the United States having jurisdiction, or his duly authorized representative, shall approve any of the provisions of this act or the order or orders of the commission which affects such lands; and, furthermore, the same shall apply to any lands committed to a unit agreement approved by the secretary of the interior or his duly authorized representative, except that the commission may, under such unit agreements, suspend the application of this act or any part of this act so long as the conservation of oil and gas and the prevention of waste as in this act provided is accomplished thereby but such suspension shall not relieve any operator from making such reports as are necessary or advised to be fully informed as to operations under such agreements and as the commission may require under this act.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c05a03s30-5-301" target="_self">30-5-301</a></cite> et seq., the district court held that defendant did not comply with WRPA's reporting requirements under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30c05a03s30-5-305ol1b" target="_self">30-5-305(b)</a></cite>; the evidence presented at trial showed that the oil company failed to submit complete monthly reports from July of 2000 through March of 2002. The district court erred by finding that defendant was required to report beginning in November of 1999, because its first sale was not until December of 1999.

      <p>
       When defendant companies sought to develop oil and gas interests, they entered into an agreement with a leaseholder for assignment of leases and for a Net Profits Interest (NPI) in which defendants agreed to pay 5% of the net profits to the leaseholder; the relevant leases began generating net profits in May 2005.

       Debtor's hedges were financial swap contracts that were purely financial, derivative transactions meant to protect debtor from the volatility of the oil and gas markets; thus, because the hedges did not affect the market value of the gas at the well or on the leased property or generate any profits from actual production at the wellhead, the gains or losses were not included in the computation of plaintiffs' net profits interest. This reading of the contract was consistent with Wyoming law regarding imposition of severance taxes on oil and gas production. Hartman v. Ultra Petro. Corp. (In re Ultra Petro.

       District court abused its discretion in dismissing a foreign limited partnership’s trespass complaint for failing to exhaust administrative remedies because the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine did not apply since the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission did not have jurisdiction under the Oil and Gas Conservation Act to consider a civil trespass; there was no specific administrative process for the partnership to bring a trespass claim to the Commission for consideration.

       The surety bond or other guaranty required under W.S. 30-5-402(c)(iv) shall be executed by the oil and gas operator, or a bonding company acceptable to the commission. Other forms of guaranty acceptable by the commission under article 1 of this chapter may be submitted by the oil and gas operator in lieu of a surety bond.
      </li>
      <li id="t30c05a04s30-5-404ol1b">
       The surety bond or other guaranty shall be in an amount of not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per well site on the land unless the operations involve seismic activities. If the operations involve seismic activities, the surety bond shall be as provided in W.S. 30-5-104(d)(v)(A). As used in this subsection, seismic activities do not include waves or vibrations originating outside the property in question. At the request of the oil and gas operator, after attempted consultation with the surface owner the commission may establish a blanket bond or other guaranty in an amount covering oil and gas operations on the surface owner’s land as identified by an oil and gas operator in the written notice required under W.S. 30-5-402(e), provided the blanket bond shall be in an amount not less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) per well site on the surface owner’s land. Neither the minimum amount of the bond or other guaranty specified or referenced in this subsection nor a blanket bond or other guaranty established by the commission is intended to establish any amount for reasonable and foreseeable damages. A permit to conduct geophysical/seismic operations issued under the authority of W.S. 30-5-104 shall include a statement that it shall not constitute authorization or permission to trespass on the surface estate. The commission shall not accept a surety bond for seismic activities for land which the oil and gas operator or seismic activity operator has no right to enter. The operator shall provide evidence of the right to enter derived from one (1) or more mineral interest owners.

       Within seven (7) days following receipt of a surety bond or other guaranty or the establishment of a blanket bond or other guaranty specified or referenced in this section, the commission shall notify the surface owner of receipt of the surety bond or other guaranty or the establishment of a blanket bond or other guaranty based on the oil and gas operator’s request and the written notice required under W.S. 30-5-402(e). The commission’s notice shall also include a description of the amount and the type of the bond or guaranty received or established and provide to the surface owner a copy of the statement required under W.S. 30-5-403(a). If, at the expiration of thirty (30) days after receipt of the commission’s notice by the surface owner, he makes no objection to the amount or the type of the surety bond or guaranty, the commission shall approve the surety bond or guaranty. If the surface owner objects in writing to the amount or the type of the surety bond or guaranty, the commission shall give immediate consideration to the surety bond or guaranty objected to and the accompanying papers filed by the oil and gas operator in support of the surety bond or guaranty amount and the type of surety bond or guaranty submitted or established, and the surface owner’s objections, and the commission shall render a final decision as to the acceptability of the amount and type of the surety bond or guaranty and shall notify the parties of the decision. Proof of any additional surety bond or guaranty required by the commission shall be filed with the commission within thirty (30) days of the commission’s final decision. Any aggrieved party may appeal the final decision of the commission to the district court in accordance with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.
