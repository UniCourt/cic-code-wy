       The most that the Wyoming liquor licensing laws do is to circumscribe the scope and extent of the wholesale or retail license. Wyoming statutes require wholesaler and retailer as well to be limited to the wholesale and retail licenses, respectively. Lamp Liquors, Inc. v.

        Meaning of “this title.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase “this title” refers to Title 12 since that is the title in which the statute appears. Thus, for purposes of entering a liquor establishment after hours under this section, only violations of Title 12 can be the basis of an officer's reasonable grounds. Mickelson v. State, 886 P.2d 247, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1994).

        Officer must have reasonable grounds to enter premises. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute's language plainly authorizes entry after hours only when an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that evidence of a violation of “this title” is occurring inside the place to be entered. Mickelson v. State, 886 P.2d 247, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) of this section requires reasonable grounds as the basis for the entry—thus, logically, the officers must have reasonable grounds before they decide to enter. Post hoc rationalizations cannot justify a decision to enter without reasonable grounds. Mickelson v. State, 886 P.2d 247, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>

       Where the police did not have reasonable grounds to demand entry to the bar pursuant to W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t12c02a03s12-2-304ol1c" target="_self">12-2-304(c)</a></cite>, and since the police did not have authority to demand entrance, appellant's refusal to admit them did not result in an interference with the performance of the officer's official duties. Mickelson v. State, 886 P.2d 247, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Shutting off the lights
   
   and not immediately leaving the bar is not a violation of the liquor code. Mickelson v. State, 886 P.2d 247, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1994).

       Laws 1963, ch. 194, § 3 amended this section by increasing the tax on malt liquors in subsection (a) from two cents to six cents per gallon and adding two subsections. The same 1963 act added provisions for liquor purchase identification cards. The 1963 act was held unconstitutional and void in toto as violating art. 3, § 24, Wyo. Const., on the ground that: (1) the increase in the tax on malt liquors was not expressed in the title; and (2) the act contained two subjects and it was impossible for the court to choose between the two objectives and hold the act valid as to one and void as to the other.

       A licensee who meets the statutory requirements for licensure has the right to expect that the license would be renewed.

       The legislature has seen fit not to grant the right of appeal when an applicant wants an original license which is denied. It is limited to those applying for a renewal. Whitesides v. Council of Cheyenne, 78 Wyo. 80, 319 P.2d 520, <cite class="wy_code">1957 Wyo. LEXIS 37</cite> (Wyo. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       When this section speaks of the renewal of a license, it speaks of one which contains the same terms and conditions as the old license, namely, one which permits the sale of intoxicating liquor at the same place as permitted in the old license. It is the denial of that kind of license from which an appeal may be taken to the district court and not from the denial of another kind. Whitesides v.

The assignment and transfer shall first have the approval of the licensing authority, which consideration shall be based in part upon a public hearing and an application filed under oath by the assignee or transferee showing the person or entity to be qualified to hold a license or permit under Wyoming law. The approval of the transfer shall not be given by the licensing authority if the transferring licensee is certified by the department as sixty (60) or more days delinquent in paying sales taxes pursuant to W.S. 12-2-306, or if proceedings are pending to suspend, revoke or otherwise penalize the original license or permit holder. A transfer of a license or permit shall require the payment of an additional license fee to the appropriate licensing authority of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for the transfer, and upon assignment the assignee may exercise the privilege of continuing the business authorized by the license or permit.

       Liquor license is privilege.

       A liquor license is deemed a privilege. Berry v. Arapahoe & Shoshone Tribes, 420 F. Supp. 934, 1976 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12845 (D. Wyo. 1976).

        Security interest may attach to license. —

      <p>
       A liquor license issued under this section is property in which a valid security interest can be acquired under the Uniform Commercial Code and the security interest attaches to the proceeds when the liquor license is sold. Bogus v. American Nat'l Bank, 401 F.2d 458, 1968 U.S. App. LEXIS 5321 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1968).

      <p>
       A note and mortgage given in exchange for the transfer of a retail liquor business and the accompanying state liquor license were illegal, void and unenforceable since the provisions of this section relating to the transfer of licenses were not followed. Scranton v. Whitlock, 389 P.2d 1015, <cite class="wy_code">1964 Wyo. LEXIS 82</cite> (Wyo. 1964).

        Lease provision requiring transfer of license to lessor valid, subject to authority's approval. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A declaratory judgment was available to construe the provision of a lease containing the requirement that the lessees transfer their liquor license to the lessor at the conclusion of the lease. Such a provision was valid and enforceable as between the parties, but was subject to the provisions of subsection (b), requiring a public hearing and approval by the licensing authority. Kurpjuweit v. Northwestern Dev. Co., 708 P.2d 39, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 584</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

        Operation of business by one other than licensee precluded. —

      <p>
       This section, if interpreted reasonably, would seem to preclude the operation of a retail liquor business in the state by one person when the license to that business is in the name of another. Scranton v. Whitlock, 389 P.2d 1015, <cite class="wy_code">1964 Wyo. LEXIS 82</cite> (Wyo. 1964).

       This statute and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t12c04a06s12-4-604" target="_self">12-4-604</a></cite> are not intended to protect the general public from physical injury. The requirement that liquor licenses only be transferred according to statute serves to assure that the regulatory authorities can administer the licensing process in an orderly fashion and that the operator of a retail liquor establishment be exposed to the scrutiny of the licensing process including a public hearing.

       Gross violation of Title 12 will necessarily violate the intent and purpose of Title 12. Thus, it remains true that the court may revoke the license or permit upon proof that the intent and purpose of Title 12 has been violated, subject to the qualification that the violation be gross.

       Actions to revoke licenses are civil actions and shall be tried before the court without a jury.

If, upon trial, it appears that the license or permit of the licensee should be revoked, the court shall enter its order accordingly. The court may revoke the license or permit upon proof that the intent and purpose of this title has been violated. The fact that no criminal proceeding has been instituted or that no law with sanctions has been violated is not a defense to the action. Upon the application of the state and upon a showing to the satisfaction of the court that there are probable grounds for believing the license holder’s license should be revoked, the court may issue an order suspending a license during the pendency of an action for its revocation and no bond shall be required as a condition to the issuance of the suspension order.

       The division may revoke any license or permit issued under this title for violation of any of the rules and regulations promulgated by the department pursuant to this title or for violation of any of the provisions of this title. Prior to suspension or final revocation of a license or permit under this chapter the division shall issue at least two (2) written notices of the intent to revoke or suspend the license or permit to the licensee. The notices shall be provided at least one (1) week apart and the final notice shall be provided at least thirty (30) days prior to any suspension or revocation. The notice shall identify the violation warranting revocation or suspension of the license or permit, the date when it will be suspended or revoked and the ability to appeal and to continue to operate as provided in this subsection. Unless the division orders otherwise, a licensee may continue to operate under the license or permit pending an appeal of a license suspension or revocation to the state board of equalization made under this subsection. Any appeal shall be filed with the state board of equalization not more than thirty (30) days following the suspension or revocation of the license or permit. Appeals before the state board shall be conducted as a contested case under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act and the state board shall either affirm or deny the action taken by the division. The state board may affirm an order of immediate suspension of a license or permit if the division demonstrates that the licensee should not be permitted to operate pending the outcome of an appeal made under this subsection. The decision of the state board shall be subject to judicial review under W.S. 16-3-114 except that the review shall not operate to stay a revocation or suspension order of the division during the pendency of the district court proceeding or during a later appeal to the supreme court. Should the license or permit of a licensee expire during the pendency of an appeal before the state board or in any of the courts of this state, no new or renewal license shall be granted by the licensing authority to the licensee or any other person pending the outcome of the appeal.

       In a case where teenage boys who were staying on the homeowners' property became intoxicated and proceeded to get in car wreck which resulted in the death of two of the boys and injuries to a third boy, because the injured boy's parents' complaint did not allege that the homeowners provided the alcohol to the boys and it did not allege that they knew or should have known that the boys would soon be driving an automobile, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to dismiss the parents' complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted pursuant to W.R.C.P. 12(b)(6).

However, upon the death of a distributor, no manufacturer shall deny approval for any transfer of ownership to a designated member of the family of an owner of a distributorship, provided, that the subsequent transfer of ownership by the designated member shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of this subsection.
