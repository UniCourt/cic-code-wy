       Mortgagees are considered “purchasers” entitled to bona fide purchaser protection.

       District court properly granted summary judgment to a bank under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 56 in a mortgage foreclosure action because it would have been improper to apply the doctrine of equitable subrogation to allow a refinancing mortgagee to be subrogated to the priority lien position held by an original mortgagee as W.S. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t34c01a01s34-1-121" target="_self">34-1-121</a></cite> was clearly a filing date priority statute and the refinancing mortgagee, which was considered a purchaser under this statute, had constructive notice of a prior lien held by a bank.

      <p>
       Court properly concluded that a lease and its concomitant authorization for an easement holder to use the right-of-way was efficacious where the easement holder already had a second right-of-way through acquisitions of rights-of-way held by its predecessors in interest, and the easement holder's use of another entity's right-of-way did not create a significant additional burden to that right-of-way or the interest a landowner had in it. In addition, the landowner cited no pertinent authority nor did he make a cogent argument that the circumstances amounted to a violation of the statute of frauds that invalidated the lease agreement between a television station and the easement holder.

       It is true that an executory contract for the sale or purchase of land is not by statute required to be recorded, and therefore, failure to record such an instrument does not vitiate it as to subsequent purchasers — interests thus engendered being determined according to general principles of law and equity, which give weight to numerous common-law maxims, including the one that, “he who is first in time has the better right.” However, the mere chronology of transactions is not sufficient to bring such principles to play in favor of a defendant.

      <p>
       It would be strange indeed if the person to whom a transfer is made by an unacknowledged and thereby unrecordable instrument could unilaterally and to his own benefit alter such an instrument so as to make it recordable. The legislature did not intend the statutes to permit this result nor should such interpretation be countenanced in equity. Low v. Sanger, 478 P.2d 60, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 214</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

        Failure to record executory contract for sale or purchase of land. —

      <p>
       It is true that an executory contract for the sale or purchase of land is not by statute required to be recorded, and therefore, failure to record such an instrument does not vitiate it as to subsequent purchasers — interests thus engendered being determined according to general principles of law and equity, which give weight to numerous common-law maxims, including the one that, “he who is first in time has the better right.” However, the mere chronology of transactions is not sufficient to bring such principles to play in favor of a defendant.

       An escrow agreement, although not recordable because unacknowledged, does not become recordable by purchaser's attachment to it of his acknowledged description and, when recorded, does not constitute constructive notice to subsequent purchasers of initial purchaser's interest.

       Application to open the investment account was a “creating instrument,” and it gave formal expression to an agreement between the company and debtor and his non-debtor wife to create rights. The application contained a handwritten note expressly labeling the account as a tenancy by the entirety; therefore, it was evident from the language of the instrument itself that the parties thereto intended to create a right of survivorship.

       Although a check may be an “instrument” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code (§ 34.1-3-102 (a)(v) (now see § 34.1-3-104)), the documents by which a bankruptcy debtor attempted to prove ownership by the entirety in certain household goods and artwork, i.e., checks, invoices and credit card bills, were not “instruments” within the meaning of that term as used by the courts to refer to a writing whereby a “chattel is embodied in a document.” Thus, with regard to such property, no “instrument” upon which an intent to create a right of survivorship could be noted. Since this property was not of the kind or nature for which the property right was in some manner embodied in a document, the property was not capable of being held by the entirety and the claimed exemption of the property in bankruptcy proceedings was disallowed.

       Certificates of stock stated that “[x] and [y]” were owners, but these parties were not designated as husband and wife, and the category of co-ownership, whether as tenants in common, joint tenants, or tenants by the entirety was not specified. From these words alone, no intention to create a right of survivorship could be found. Absent such a right of survivorship, the husband and wife held the stock certificates as tenants in common and the husband's one-half interest in the certificates was subject to the claims of his creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.

       Wyoming's easement statute was not applied retroactively because an easement was obtained in 1979 by previous owners of a property, which preceded the enactment of Wyoming's easement statute. Therefore, the easement was valid and enforceable despite the lack of a specific description of its location.

In the event a description of the surface is used, the transfer shall be deemed to include pore space at all depths underlying the described surface area unless specifically excluded.

       Conservation easement administrator did not err in rejecting the owners’ plans to construct a main residence, a guest house, and a caretaker’s quarters on each of the two parcels governed by the conservation easement because the easement unambiguously limited the owners to construction of one single-family residential structure and associated improvements; the phrase “associated improvements” was unambiguous and did not include additional residential structures such as guest houses or caretaker’s quarters; fulfilling the purposes of the easement did not grant a license to disregard the limitation of one residential structure; and zoning regulations could not override the restrictions placed on the property by the easement.

       A requirement that a document or a signature associated with a document be notarized, acknowledged, verified, witnessed or made under oath is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform that act, and all other information required to be included, is attached to or logically associated with the document or signature.

      Whether transaction is mortgage. —

     A transaction constituted a mortgage where: (1) the borrowers deeded their property to the lender, (2) there was a great disparity between the value of the property and the sale price, and (3) the parties contemporaneously entered into an installment contract for the reconveyance of the property back to the borrowers upon payment of the amount borrowed.

      <p>
       Given the definition of right of way in 1910, it would have been unusual for someone in 1913 to believe the grant of a right of way meant a fee-simple conveyance, and instead, the drafter would have considered a conveyance of a right of way to grant only an easement; construing the deeds against the drafter and giving right of way its plain meaning as understood in 1913, the deeds at issue conveyed only a limited grant and indicated that the grantor conveyed a right of way, which meant an easement in 1913.

       Where two brother agreed to partition their ranch and agreed that, if a railway right-of-way traversing their ranch was ever abandoned, they would execute any necessary documents to vest the other with full title in the right-of-way over his respective portion, where years later, one brother purchased the right-of-way but his successors (defendants) refused to execute documents to fully vest the second brother's successors (plaintiffs) with title to the right of way over their portion, and where plaintiffs filed suit seeking specific performance, the district court erred in entering summary judgment for defendants because the unambiguous contractual language required defendants, as the first brother's successors, to convey whatever interest they received in the right of way over the second brother's land to plaintiffs, the second brother's successors. The brothers'
   agreement reflected in the warranty deeds unambiguously reflected an intent to cross-convey all of the interest the brothers owned in the land within the right-of-way to the brother who received the adjacent property as part of the partition and cross-conveyance of the entire ranch.

     <p>
      In all instruments conveying real estate, or interests therein, in which the grantee is described as trustee, agent, or as in any other representative capacity, the instruments of conveyance shall also define the trust or other agreement under which the grantee is acting. In all instruments conveying real estate, or interests therein, in which the grantee is described as a trust, the instrument of conveyance shall also define the trust or other instrument and shall be deemed to have vested title in the trustee or trustees of the trust. For purposes of this section, it shall be sufficient to define a trust by providing in the text of the instrument the name of the trustee or trustees and the name of the trust, the date of the trust or other agreement, or by referring by proper description of the affecting record book, page, document number or file, to the instrument, order, decree or other writing, which is of public record in the county in which the land so conveyed is located and in which the required information appears; otherwise the description of a grantee in any representative capacity in each instrument of conveyance shall be considered and held to be a description of the grantee, only, and shall not be notice of any trust, agency or other representative capacity of the grantee who shall be held as vested with the power to convey, transfer, encumber or release the affected title. Whenever the grantee shall execute and deliver a conveyance, transfer, encumbrance or release of the property in a representative capacity, it shall not thereafter be questioned by anyone claiming as a beneficiary under the trust or agency or by anyone claiming by, through or under any undisclosed beneficiary. Trust property in the name of the trustee, agent or representative and owned only in that capacity shall not be subject to execution for the grantee’s individual obligations.

       A wild deed
   may constitute the “root of title” under this section, and a wild
   deed serving as a root of title that does not bear a defect on its
   face is not an inherent defect in the chain of record title. Esterholdt v. Pacificorp, 2013 WY 64, 301 P.3d 1086, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 68</cite> (Wyo. 2013).

      <p>
       Pole line
   easement across plaintiffs' property that was granted to the power
   company's predecessor in interest was a “wild deed,” because the
   grantor signed the easement in his capacity as president of a company
   that had no ownership interest in the property. The court refused
   to declare the easement as invalid, because nothing in the Wyoming
   Marketable Title Act suggested that a wild deed could not be the root
   of title for a contestant in a controversy under the Act.

      <p>
       Rather than resulting in an easement to the public in the platted area designated for streets, statutory dedication creates three separate interests: (1) the first is an estate in fee simple determinable in the surface estate conveyed to the public authority, with the transferor retaining a possibility of reverter; (2) this possibility of reverter comprises the second interest generated; (3) the third interest is a mineral estate in fee lying below the street, and created by horizontal severance upon dedication.

       It could not be contended that, if a private owner dedicates a street or a block in a city to public use the public could convey it to a private party and have the property placed to some other use or purpose than that for which it was originally dedicated.

       A dedication under this section, absent some other applicable statute, does not vest in a municipality a fee in the premises set apart for streets which upon vacation of the streets can be bartered and sold by the municipality.

       This chapter seems to be an almost verbatim copy of the Revised Code of Iowa 1882, § 559 and subsequent sections. The Iowa court has held the section of the Iowa statute corresponding to this section has no application to municipalities but that the powers to be exercised by the city in vacating a street should be exercised under the provision similar to those in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.15.html#t15c06a01s15-6-104" target="_blank">15-6-104</a></cite>.Thomas v.

       A custodian may extend the custodial term under this section to an age older than the age that is specified by this act or a transferring instrument made under W.S. 34-13-122, subject to the right of the minor to compel immediate distribution under subsection (c) of this section.

       To extend the custodial term under subsection (a) of this section, the custodian shall give the minor written notice of the custodian’s intent to extend the custodial term. The notice must specify the duration of the extension by indicating the new custodial term and must inform the minor of the minor’s right to compel immediate distribution under subsection (c) of this section. The custodian shall give the notice during the later of the following periods:
       <ol type="i">

       Whenever condominium ownership of real property is created, or separate assessment of condominium units is desired, a written notice thereof shall be delivered to the assessor of the county in which said real property is situated, which notice shall set forth descriptions of the condominium units. Thereafter all taxes, assessments and other charges of this state or of any political subdivision or of any special improvement district or any other taxing or assessing authority shall be assessed against and collected on each condominium unit, each of which shall be carried on the tax books as a separate and distinct parcel for the purpose, and not on the building or property as a whole. The valuation of the general and limited common elements shall be assessed proportionately upon the individual air space unit in the manner provided in the declaration. The lien for taxes assessed to any individual condominium owner shall be confined to his condominium unit and to his undivided interest in the general and limited common elements. No forfeiture or sale of any condominium unit for delinquent taxes, mechanics, laborers or materialmen’s liens, assessments or charges shall divest or in any way affect the title of other condominium units.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c20s34-20-104ol1b">
       The declaration shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk where the condominium property is located. Such declaration shall provide for the filing for record of a map properly locating condominium units. Any instrument affecting the condominium unit may legally describe it by the identifying condominium unit number or symbol as shown on such map. If such declaration provides for the disposition of condominium units in the event of the destruction or obsolescence of buildings in which such units are situated and restricts partition of the common elements, the rules or laws known as the rule against perpetuities and the rule prohibiting unlawful restraints on alienation shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.
      </li>
      <li id="t34c20s34-20-104ol1c">
       To the extent that any such declaration shall contain a mandatory requirement that all condominium unit owners shall be members of an association or corporation, or provide for the payment of charges assessed by the association upon condominium units, or the appointment of an attorney-in-fact to deal with the property upon its destruction or obsolescence, any rule of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the same shall be considered as covenants running with the land binding upon all condominium owners and their successors in interest. Any common law rule terminating agency upon death or disability of a principal shall not be applied to defeat or limit any such provisions.

Any buyer of farm products, commission merchant, selling agent or other person conducting business from multiple locations shall be considered as one (1) entity. Registration shall be on an annual calendar year basis. The secretary of state shall provide the form for registration which shall include the name and address of the registrant and the list or lists described in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section which the registrant desires to receive.
