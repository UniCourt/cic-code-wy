      Suspension of accountant's certificate to practice was proper, where substantial evidence showed that accountant participated in the audit prior to having approval to do so, and thus he violated a settlement agreement from a prior disciplinary action and engaged in dishonesty in violation of W.S. 33-3-121(a)(ii) when he attempted to legitimize his activity by using other accountants as the signing auditors. While the violation of the settlement agreement, alone, probably did not amount to dishonesty under W.S. 33-3-121(a)(ii), the accountant's attempt to legitimize his activity was dishonest.

      An accountant's failure to inform a client of a restriction placed on his ability to conduct audits by a settlement agreement did not amount to dishonesty in the practice of public accounting since (1) the agreement did not require that he inform a prospective audit client that his license was restricted, and (2) when he was contacted about performing an audit, he immediately filed a request with the board of certified public accountants to conduct the audit and to initiate the pre-issuance review required by the settlement agreement.

A renewal license shall be issued by the board upon application and payment of the renewal fee, and shall be for a two (2) year period. Application for renewal shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the board of compliance with this act and participation in continuing education activities as established by rules and regulations of the board, provided that requirements for renewal shall be no more stringent than the requirements recommended by the national council of architectural registration boards or the council of landscape architectural registration boards.

      Chiropractic is the system of specific adjustment or manipulation of the joints and tissues of the body and the treatment of the human body by the application of manipulative, manual, mechanical, physiotherapeutic or clinical nutritional methods for which those persons licensed under this chapter are trained and may include venipuncture, acupuncture and the use of diagnostic x-rays with rights for referral for advanced diagnostic imaging. A chiropractor may examine, diagnose and treat patients provided, however, chiropractors shall not perform surgery, direct the use of or administer drugs required by law to be dispensed on prescription only, practice obstetrics or prescribe or administer x-ray therapy.

      Where patients testified that they were victims of a chiropractor who touched their breasts and pubic areas and made inappropriate remarks during chiropractic treatment, the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that defendant's conduct was third degree sexual assault because he was in a position of authority over his patients. While not engaged in the practice of medicine for purposes of this section, chiropractors governed themselves by ethical codes advising practitioners not to take physical advantage of any patient.

      Where patients testified that they were victims of a chiropractor who touched their breasts and pubic areas and made inappropriate remarks during chiropractic treatment, the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that defendant's conduct was third degree sexual assault because he was in a position of authority over his patients. While not engaged in the practice of medicine for purposes of this section, chiropractors governed themselves by ethical codes advising practitioners not to take physical advantage of any patient.

      effective July 1, 2013, rewrote (a) and (a)(i) and added (a)(xv), (a)(xvi) and (g); and repealed former (b) through (e) which read: “(b) The board shall refuse to issue a license or certificate to any applicant proved guilty of any of the acts stated in section (a), and the board may revoke the license and certificate or suspend the license and certificate of any licensee proved guilty of any of the acts stated in section (a). (c) Before refusing, revoking or suspending any license or certificate for any of the causes stated in section (a), the board shall give notice in writing by mailing by United States registered mail to the licensee or applicant at his last known address in Wyoming a statement of the nature of the offense charged. The licensee or applicant shall have thirty (30) days after mailing of the notice to file with the board a written statement of the nature of his defense. If no defense shall have been filed, the board shall proceed ex parte forthwith to hear proof of the charge, and, if proven, shall refuse, suspend or revoke the license and certificate. If the licensee or applicant shall file a defense, the matter forthwith shall be set for hearing by the board. (d)
      At the hearing, the board shall be represented and advised by the attorney general and any complainant, applicant or licensee may be represented by counsel. The board and any complainant, applicant or licensee shall have the power to require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of papers. The fees and mileage for witnesses shall be the same as prescribed by law for trial by district courts in civil cases. In case of disobedience to a subpoena, the aid of any court of competent jurisdiction may be invoked and such court may issue an order requiring the witness to appear before the board and give evidence and to produce papers and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. The testimony at the hearing shall be recorded in shorthand or by some other generally used method of taking and recording testimony if required by the board or demanded by the complainant, applicant or licensee, provided that the board or party making such demand shall arrange and pay for the same. (e) Within thirty (30) days after the hearing, the board shall make its order in writing stating its decision. The complainant, applicant or licensee may appeal from such order to the district court in which he resides or to the district court of Laramie county by filing with the board within fifteen (15) days thereafter a written notice of appeal. Within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of appeal, unless the time shall be extended by order of the court appealed to, the board shall certify and deliver to the district court appealed to the original statement of the nature of the offense charged and the defense, or true and certified copies thereof. The appellant shall have five (5) days thereafter to perfect his appeal by filing with the clerk of the district court and with the board and any other parties a copy of the notice of appeal and a petition stating the grounds for the appeal, and if appellant shall fail to do so within the time fixed, the appeal shall be dismissed with prejudice by the court. The order shall remain in effect during the appeal unless the judge of the district court appealed to at any time after making of the order by the board, after three (3) days notice to the board giving an opportunity to be heard with respect thereto, shall fix a bond in a sum to be determined by the court in favor of the people of the state of Wyoming and conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements of his license during the appeal. Said bond shall be for the benefit of any persons damaged by any act of the appellant during the appeal or any time prior thereto, and any person so damaged may bring an action against the appellant and the sureties on the bond. Trial before the district court on said appeal shall be de novo and without a jury. The judgment of the district court may be appealed to the supreme court in the manner provided by law for appeal of civil matters.”

While not engaged in the practice of medicine for purposes of this section, chiropractors governed themselves by ethical codes advising practitioners not to take physical advantage of any patient.

The restrictive language as used by the legislature in the Wyoming Dental Practice Act limits those licensed by that act to the practice of anesthesiology solely for purposes in connection with the oral cavity region. Also, the practice of general nondental anesthesiology is considered the “practice of medicine” as defined by the Paravecchio v. Memorial Hosp., 742 P.2d 1276,

     To declare unconstitutional this chapter, having to do with the medical profession and its regulation, would be a serious thing and to do so there must be ample and good reason. The objection should be grave and the conflict between it and the constitution substantial. State v. Pitet, 69 Wyo. 478, 243 P.2d 177,

     This chapter, as ch. 45, Laws 1905, with the title “Board of Medical Examiners xxx,” did not violate art. 3, §§ 24 and 26, Wyo.

       Naturopathy is simply one of the methods of practicing medicine. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The practice of what is now called naturopathy has from time immemorial, at least to the extent then known, been considered simply as an integral part of the practice of medicine. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,

       It cannot be regarded as a separate and distinct profession. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Our statute is clear, that the practice of naturopathy cannot be regarded as a separate and distinct profession like that of dentistry for instance, nor can any good reason be given why the legislature may not for the benefit of society require that those who practice the healing art should know and keep up with the improvements and advanced learning in that art. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,
      <cite class="wy_code">

       And legislature had perfect right to refuse to make special regulations. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      It is true that the legislature has licensed dentists and chiropractors and other persons who in some manner attempt to exercise part of the healing art, but simply because the legislature made special regulations for these groups did not require it to make similar regulations concerning naturopaths. It had a perfect right to refuse to provide such regulations relating to them. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,
      <cite class="wy_code">

       And require practitioner to have been admitted to practice as a physician or surgeon. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The health and well-being of the members of society is too important to justify the failure to make requirements commensurate with the advancement of civilization. There is nothing to prohibit the practice of naturopathy provided that under our statute the practitioner has the learning of a physician and surgeon and has been admitted to practice as such in this state.

      The practice of medicine, in its broadest sense, is the art of healing disease and preserving health, and the license to practice medicine or surgery generally entitles the licensee to practice medicine or surgery in all the various branches and to use any method for treatment and healing human ailments, although others may be authorized to practice in limited fields of the general practice.

      The practice of what is now called naturopathy has from time immemorial, at least to the extent then known, been considered simply as an integral part of the practice of medicine. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,

     <p>
      Our statute is clear, that the practice of naturopathy cannot be regarded as a separate and distinct profession like that of dentistry for instance, nor can any good reason be given why the legislature may not for the benefit of society require that those who practice the healing art should know and keep up with the improvements and advanced learning in that art.

     <p>
      It is true that the legislature has licensed dentists and chiropractors and other persons who in some manner attempt to exercise part of the healing art, but simply because the legislature made special regulations for these groups did not require it to make similar regulations concerning naturopaths. It had a perfect right to refuse to provide such regulations relating to them. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,

      The health and well-being of the members of society is too important to justify the failure to make requirements commensurate with the advancement of civilization. There is nothing to prohibit the practice of naturopathy provided that under our statute the practitioner has the learning of a physician and surgeon and has been admitted to practice as such in this state.

       Dentist unauthorized to practice general nondental anesthesiology. —

     <p>
      A person licensed to practice dentistry in Wyoming who has special training and experience in the field of general anesthesia, but is not a licensed physician in Wyoming, is not authorized to practice general anesthesiology for nondental purposes. The restrictive language as used by the legislature in the Wyoming Dental Practice Act limits those licensed by that act to the practice of anesthesiology solely for purposes in connection with the oral cavity region. Also, the practice of general nondental anesthesiology is considered the “practice of medicine” as defined by the Paravecchio v. Memorial Hosp., 742 P.2d 1276,

      The practice of medicine, in its broadest sense, is the art of healing disease and preserving health, and the license to practice medicine or surgery generally entitles the licensee to practice medicine or surgery in all the various branches and to use any method for treatment and healing human ailments, although others may be authorized to practice in limited fields of the general practice.

      Findings of fact made by the Wyoming Board of Medicine supported its conclusion that the doctor exploited her professional relationship with the patient under the plain meaning of the term; but for the doctor’s licensure as a physician, she would not have had access to the patient, nor would she have been able to command the trust and reliance that allowed her to exert control over the patient, her finances, and her ranch.

       Practice of naturopathy dependent upon admission to practice as physician or surgeon. —

     </p>
     <p>
      The health and well-being of the members of society is too important to justify the failure to make requirements commensurate with the advancement of civilization. There is nothing to prohibit the practice of naturopathy provided that under our statute the practitioner has the learning of a physician and surgeon and has been admitted to practice as such in this state. Such a requirement is valid. Hahn v. State, 78 Wyo. 258, 322 P.2d 896,

       Practice of naturopathy cannot be regarded as separate and distinct profession. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Our statute is clear, that the practice of naturopathy cannot be regarded as a separate and distinct profession, like that of dentistry for instance, nor is there any good reason why the legislature may not for the benefit of society require that those who practice the healing art should know and keep up with the improvements and advanced learning in that art.

       Application in prosecution for manslaughter. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the defendant was not prosecuted for practicing medicine without a license under this section nor for violating the former provisions relating to chiropody, the jury had the right to know and to take into consideration the fact that the defendant, charged with manslaughter, was not a licensed physician or surgeon, in determining whether or not the defendant was guilty of criminal negligence in administering an anesthetic to the deceased. State v. Catellier, 63 Wyo. 123, 179 P.2d 203,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       1947 Wyo. LEXIS 8
      </cite>
      (Wyo. 1947).
     </p>
     <p>
      If the defendant practiced medicine without a license, and death to his patient ensued as the proximate cause thereof, he would be guilty of manslaughter, at least if his treatment was with criminal negligence. State v. Catellier, 63 Wyo. 123, 179 P.2d 203,

        Purpose
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       In order to strengthen access to health care and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state’s existing medical practice act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.

       Rejected applicant's course work not “primarily psychological.” —

     <p>
      Where the evidence showed the applicant had 20 hours of credit in psychology and psychology-related courses which represented roughly 30% of his total course work, the board was correct in finding applicant's doctoral program was not “primarily psychological” in nature and that this requirement was substantially different from the Illinois requirements under which he had been licensed. If the Wyoming board were to license the appellant based upon the law in Illinois, it would be tantamount to abdicating its authority to license applicants in Wyoming under Wyoming law. Sellers v.

      Under former provisions as to real estate brokers, enacted in exercise of the police power of the state, a person, regularly engaged in another occupation and not licensed under such provisions, who acted as a real estate broker or salesman in but a single isolated real estate transaction, was held to have done so in violation of the provisions and could not receive agreed compensation for such services under an express verbal agreement.

      Where 1 of 2 purchasers of real estate, who was not licensed, sought to recover portion of commission paid on their joint purchase to other purchaser who was duly licensed broker, recovery, which was denied, would have amounted to his receiving a commission contrary to the former provisions as to brokers even though the transaction was an isolated one.

        Section 1 Purpose
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The purpose of this Compact is to facilitate interstate practice of audiology and speech-language pathology with the goal of improving public access to audiology and speech-language pathology services. The practice of audiology and speech-language pathology occurs in the state where the patient/client/student is located at the time of the patient/client/student encounter. The Compact preserves the regulatory authority of states to protect public health and safety through the current system of state licensure. This Compact is designed to achieve the following objectives:

      </h4>
      <p>
       In order to protect
       the public through verification of competency and ensure accountability
       for patient care related activities all states license emergency medical
       services (EMS) personnel, such as emergency medical technicians (EMTs),
       advanced EMTs and paramedics. This Compact is intended to facilitate
       the day to day movement of EMS personnel across state boundaries in
       the performance of their EMS duties as assigned by an appropriate
       authority and authorize state EMS offices to afford immediate legal
       recognition to EMS personnel licensed in a member state. This Compact
       recognizes that states have a vested interest in protecting the public’s
       health and safety through their licensing and regulation of EMS personnel
       and that such state regulation shared among the member states will
       best protect public health and safety. This Compact is designed to
       achieve the following purposes and objectives:

      Act violates equal protection. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the Mental Health Professions Practice Act, private counselors rights to equal protection have been transgressed; none of the evidence demonstrates that supervision by public, licensed counselors results in the qualification of counselors who are more competent or more ethical and, thus, more likely to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The differentiation of the public employer or the charitable employer from the private, for-profit employer cannot be justified as a proper classification and, thus, is not a legitimate exercise in police power. This classification is not founded on a reasonable basis, is arbitrary, and constitutes unwarranted discrimination. It is a violation of equal protection and must be set aside. Allhusen v. State, 898 P.2d 878,

      Where the evidence showed the applicant had 20 hours of credit in psychology and psychology-related courses which represented roughly 30% of his total course work, the board was correct in finding applicant's doctoral program was not “primarily psychological” in nature and that this requirement was substantially different from the Illinois requirements under which he had been licensed. If the Wyoming board were to license the appellant based upon the law in Illinois, it would be tantamount to abdicating its authority to license applicants in Wyoming under Wyoming law. Sellers v.

      Where appellant was denied re-licensure of his clinical social work license under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 33-38-110(c), the Wyoming Mental Health Professions Licensing Board was not required to present expert testimony that appellant violated Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 33-38-102(a)(iii) and (v) by representing himself as a clinical social worker and practicing clinical social work without a license because the re-licensure was denied on the grounds that appellant violated Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 33-38-110(a)(i) and (c)(iii), the Board meticulously detailed in its order the applicable statutory and administrative standards, including the ethical codes adopted therein and further, the evidence fully supported the conclusion that the appellant engaged in practices clearly identified in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 33-38-102(a)(v) as ‘clinical social work,’ including diagnosis and counseling. In re Licensure of Jerry Penny v. State ex rel. Wyo.

      Although it was error for the sentencing court to allow on cross-examination a substance abuse therapist to disclose information privileged under § 33-38-113(a) concerning the defendant, specifically, that defendant was involved in the sale and use of controlled substance, the error was harmless in light of defendant's extensive criminal record, including more than twenty-five serious felony and misdemeanor convictions, including at least one for possessing and one for delivering a controlled substance, coupled with the presentence investigation recommendation that defendant be sentenced to the maximum penalty.
