                        W.S. 21-13-101(a)(xiv) and as maintained under this subsection, shall be made available for public inspection by the state superintendent in electronic format. Copies of the block grant model spreadsheets as administered under
                        department rule and regulation shall be provided to school districts by the state superintendent for district use in district budgeting and in complying with mandatory financial reporting requirements imposed under W.S. 21-13-307(b)

                        foundation program amount for each school district under W.S. 21-13-309(p) and determining the amount to be distributed to a district under W.S. 21-13-311 or recaptured from a district subject to W.S. 21-13-102(b), the state superintendent
                        shall certify to the legislature that the block grant model as enacted by the legislature is properly incorporated into the administration of the model for the appropriate school year of model application and is made available
                        for public inspection. Technical corrections to model spreadsheets necessary for model administration between any session of the legislature shall be implemented by the state superintendent, shall be in accordance with procedures
                        specified by rule and regulation filed with the secretary of state, shall be reported to the legislature together with the associated fiscal and technical impact of the correction, and shall be incorporated into the electronic
                        version of the model available for public inspection. As used in this subsection, “technical corrections to model spreadsheets” means corrections necessary to ensure model operation and current school year district payments are
                        in accordance with law and the model is properly computing school foundation program payments to school districts as required by law. Notwithstanding W.S. 16-3-114(c), no judicial review of rules promulgated and adopted under this
                        subsection shall hold unlawful or set aside action of the state superintendent in promulgating or adopting rules unless the rules are by clear and convincing evidence, shown to exceed statutory authority.

                        termination for reasons unrelated to teaching performance;

                    <p>
                        “(v) Current law goes beyond the intended purpose of tenure and provides an obstacle to removing nonperforming teachers and thereby serves to protect jobs for nonperforming teachers at the expense of student performance. This, in turn, creates higher
                        demands on performing teachers to remediate lagging student performance.

                        and status. The basis for the performance evaluation system shall be built upon the educational accountability system and the assessments and measures within the accountability system identified by law to measure student achievement

                        school year. The assessment system is to measure student progress based upon the uniform educational program established under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c09a01s21-9-101" target="_self">21-9-101</a></cite> and measurable
                        academic student performance standards imposed by law and rule and regulation of the state board of education. Any vacancy in the membership of the task force is to be filled by the appointing authority prescribed under Laws 2003,
                        ch. 208, § 201(b). For purposes of carrying out the requirements of this section and to ensure the assessment system adheres to principles of sound education policy and test measurement, necessary technical, policy and legal experts
                        and representatives from the education community and federal and state governmental agencies are to be assembled on behalf of the task force and the state superintendent.

                        Laws 2004, ch. 109, § 3, directs the statewide task force and the state superintendent to establish necessary mechanisms and processes to support the transition from the statewide student assessment existing on the effective date of the act to the student
                        assessment system established in accordance with W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c02a03s21-2-304ol1av" target="_self">21-2-304(a)(v)</a></cite> as amended by section 1 of the act. The pilot test of

                        force, issue a request for proposal (RFP) for statewide student assessment development in sufficient time for pilot testing during the 2004-2005 school year. If a proposal meets the specifications and requirements and is approved
                        by the task force, the state superintendent is to submit the proposal to the state board for review and accept the proposal and enter into contract to implement the proposal subject to funds available within the state superintendent's
                        budget to implement its provision. On or before November 1, 2004, the state superintendent and the task force are to report to the state board of education, the management council and the joint education interim committee on recommendations
                        developed under this section, clearly specifying progress on development of the statewide assessment system, defining the assessment system and reporting on the development and administration of a pilot test for the assessment.

                    The board of trustees of any school district may arrange to make accident insurance for medical, hospital, injury, or death benefits available to any or all pupils. The cost of such insurance may be paid from the funds of the district, or by the parent

                        school year 2009-2010, including the 2009 summer session. Based upon the report submitted by each recipient district and on or before June 30, 2010, the department shall pay each district the remaining twenty-five percent (25%)
                        of the amount computed under subsection (c) of this section, adjusted to reflect actual program enrollment and completion. If the appropriation from the foundation program account under subsection (f) of this section is insufficient
                        to make payments under this subsection, the department shall make a pro rata reduction in the final payment made to all districts under this subsection.

                        requirements imposed under this section. On or before December 1, 2009, the department shall report to the joint education interim committee on financial assistance distributions made under this section based upon estimated student
                        enrollment numbers, and shall provide recommendations to the committee on program continuation.

            <p>
                Laws 1997, ch. 189, § 4, provides: “The legislature recognizes organization into unified districts under the Wyoming School District Organization Act of 1969 has been completed to the extent contemplated by that act. This act is not intended to require
                the reorganization or adjustment of the boundaries of any current school district, but is to be construed to allow more streamlined and less cumbersome reorganization and boundary adjustments of school districts as specified in this act.
                Nothing in this act authorizes the operation of a non-unified school district other than those elementary school districts properly operating as of the effective date of this act. Nothing in this act authorizes the creation of any additional
                non-unified school districts.”

                        The indebtedness spread in the creation of a unified school district is not a new burden; no new debt is created; there is merely a division of one already existing. Lund v.

                        A discharge of a continuing contract teacher is lawful only if substantial evidence shows the existence of good cause, and the teacher is given a hearing by an impartial board as required by the Administrative Procedure Act. Simineo v. School Dist., 594

                <p>
                    An initial contract teacher who has taught in the system continuously for a period of at least ninety (90) days shall be hired on an annual basis and shall be notified in writing of the reasons for termination, if such is the case, no later than April
                    15 of each year. An initial contract teacher’s employment may be terminated for any reason not specifically prohibited by law, and a board is not limited to the reasons set forth in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c07a01s21-7-110ol1a" target="_self">21-7-110(a)</a></cite>.

                        Phrase “notice of termination” refers to the notice of recommendation of termination, not to some final document issued by a board of trustees after reviewing a hearing officer's suggested disposition of the case. Therefore, a teacher was not entitled
                        to compensation following the end of the 2011-12 school year after he was not reemployed because the term “notice of termination” did not mean something other than notice of recommendation of termination; the terms were used interchangeable
                        to designate a single document. Laramie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. One ex rel. Bd. of Trs. v. Kinstler, 2015 WY 143, 361 P.3d 819, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 159</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

                        A hearing on termination of a continuing contract teacher involves the question of whether there is good cause for termination. There must not only be good cause but there must be substantial evidence before the board to show that there is good cause.
                        Absent either, a decision on the part of the board to terminate will be arbitrary. Monahan v. Board of Trustees, 486 P.2d 235, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 226</cite> (Wyo. 1971); Powell v. Board

                        Nonrenewal of a teacher's contract based in part on a protected activity and in part upon an unprotected activity is not a proper decision. Board of Trustees v. Spiegel, 549 P.2d 1161, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 191</cite>                        (Wyo. 1976).

                        It is not imperative that a teacher prove that the sole reason for his failure to have his contract renewed was his participation in constitutionally protected activities. If his penalty was imposed by the board for “even partially” being “in retaliation”
                        for his exercise of a protected right such as freedom of speech, he is entitled to relief. Board of Trustees v. Spiegel, 549 P.2d 1161, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 191</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

                        and progressive discipline was not required. Mirich v. State ex rel. Bd. of Trs., 2021 WY 32, 481 P.3d 627, <cite class="wy_code">2021 Wyo. LEXIS 39</cite> (Wyo. 2021).

                        Phrase “notice of termination” refers to the notice of recommendation of termination, not to some final document issued by a board of trustees after reviewing a hearing officer's suggested disposition of the case. Therefore, a teacher was not entitled
                        to compensation following the end of the 2011-12 school year after he was not reemployed because the term “notice of termination” did not mean something other than notice of recommendation of termination; the terms were used interchangeable
                        to designate a single document. Laramie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. One ex rel. Bd. of Trs. v. Kinstler, 2015 WY 143, 361 P.3d 819, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 159</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

                        “Insubordination” includes willful refusal of teacher to obey reasonable rules and regulations, with emphasis on the presence of a persistent course of willful defiance.

                        Not only must there be “good cause” and substantial evidence in support of a charge against a teacher, but in order for the facts to sustain such a charge they must bear reasonable relationship to the teacher's fitness or capacity to perform his duties

                        A failure to establish rapport with the students, by and of itself, is not “a good or just cause” as required by this section as a matter of law. Powell v. Board of Trustees, 550 P.2d 1112, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 198</cite>                        (Wyo. 1976).

                        A general charge of “inability to establish rapport with his students,” unsupported by definition and specific facts going straight to the charge, is insufficient, standing alone, to constitute “other good or just cause” under this section, or the good
                        cause which is necessary to insulate the order of termination or dismissal against capriciousness and arbitrariness. Powell v. Board of Trustees, 550 P.2d 1112, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 198</cite>                        (Wyo. 1976).

                        The 1945 legislature by inserting an item designated as “reimbursements” in the state budget for the use of the division of vocational education did not intend by the use of the word “reimbursements” to provide reimbursement to a lumber company who advanced
                        wages of instructors hired to teach the lumber business to war prisoners based on an alleged agreement by the state board of education to reimburse it from state funds. The word “reimbursements” was intended by the legislature
                        to refer to repayment of funds advanced by school districts and other state and municipal training course authorities in vocational education. State ex rel. R. R. Crow &amp; Co. v. Copenhaver, 64 Wyo. 1, 184 P.2d 594,

                    published in the county, during the month in which such warrants were canceled. Any person or persons holding a school district warrant which has been canceled under the provisions of this section, may present such warrant to the board
                    of trustees of such school district at any subsequent time, not later than five (5) years after the date such warrant was canceled. The said board of trustees shall issue to the holder of such school district warrant, a new warrant

                        based upon study of findings contained within the November 2002 report on the regional cost adjustment to the education resource block grant model, conducted in accordance with Laws 2002, ch. 76, § 13, a copy of which is on file
                        with the legislative service office. Recommendations are to define a rigorous statistical adjustment that considers and accounts for salary demands in all regions of the state and should minimize incentives for discretionary actions
                        by school districts to impact adjustment estimations. The report is to be submitted to the joint education interim committee on or before October 1, 2003. Following receipt of this report, the joint education interim committee
                        is to submit recommendations and enabling legislation to the legislature which implement a regional cost adjustment to the education resource block grant model for school year 2004-2005 and each school year thereafter. Recommendations

                        If the state chooses to use the Wyoming cost of living index to adjust the statewide average salaries to address situations where the cost of living exceeds the statewide average, there is not now and never has been a constitutional requirement that those

                        there were complaints about leaving the decision regarding inflation adjustments in the hands of the legislature each year, the expenditure of state funds was the legislature's responsibility, and whether it adopted a particular
                        index, which it could change at any time it chose, or whether it made a judgment biannually in the budgetary process, did not control the determination of whether school funding was constitutional, and not based on wealth-based

                        Under provisions authorizing school boards to create bonded indebtedness for erection or enlargement of school buildings, there is impliedly included power to use portion of proceeds to purchase and install equipment necessary for its use, and bonds issued
                        for such purpose cannot be affected by fact that school board might thereafter, without participation of bondholders, use part of the money for purposes which might not be lawful. Jewett v. School Dist., 49 Wyo. 277, 54 P.2d 546,

                    Each school district actually and physically operating within its boundaries a school shall have a limit on outstanding indebtedness of ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of the taxable property therein. Nothing in this section shall be construed
                    as permitting any combination of school districts embracing common territory to incur a bonded indebtedness of more than ten percent (10%) of the assessed value of the taxable property therein. The amount in any sinking fund available
                    for the payment of outstanding indebtedness may be deducted for the purpose of computing the debt-incurring power of such district. For this purpose, any general assessment for a particular district shall become effective when the
                    county assessor shall have received notice from the state board of equalization of its final approval of the county valuations; provided, however, that if the county assessor receives such notice after the district has entered into
                    an enforceable contract for the sale of bonds, a new lower assessed valuation shall not become effective until the day following the date of delivery of such bonds.

                        Legislature required that the Wyoming School Facilities Commission (SFC) to establish and maintain uniform statewide standards for the adequacy of school buildings and facilities and that the SFC make an annual report regarding all aspects of the school
                        facilities needs, including buildings deemed inadequate, expenditures, progress, and upcoming budgetary needs; under the statutory scheme, the legislature provided for capital construction funding from state wealth without reliance
                        upon local wealth as a source of capital, mandated that facilities be remedied to a point requiring only routine maintenance, and made adequacy of the facilities a function of delivering adequate education programs. The legislature
                        has acted to increase the speed of repair or replacement and continues to appropriate large sums; that continued aggressive legislative oversight over capital construction was obtaining results as part of a constitutional statutory
                        scheme to eliminate wealth-based disparities in the state school system. Campbell County Sch. Dist. v. State, 2008 WY 2, 181 P.3d 43, <cite class="wy_code">2008 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. 2008).

                        Legislature required that the Wyoming School Facilities Commission (SFC) to establish and maintain uniform statewide standards for the adequacy of school buildings and facilities and that the SFC make an annual report regarding all aspects of the school
                        facilities needs, including buildings deemed inadequate, expenditures, progress, and upcoming budgetary needs; under the statutory scheme, the legislature provided for capital construction funding from state wealth without reliance
                        upon local wealth as a source of capital, mandated that facilities be remedied to a point requiring only routine maintenance, and made adequacy of the facilities a function of delivering adequate education programs. The legislature
                        has acted to increase the speed of repair or replacement and continues to appropriate large sums; that continued aggressive legislative oversight over capital construction was obtaining results as part of a constitutional statutory
                        scheme to eliminate wealth-based disparities in the state school system. Campbell County Sch. Dist. v. State, 2008 WY 2, 181 P.3d 43, <cite class="wy_code">2008 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. 2008).

                        Legislature required that the Wyoming School Facilities Commission (SFC) to establish and maintain uniform statewide standards for the adequacy of school buildings and facilities and that the SFC make an annual report regarding all aspects of the school
                        facilities needs, including buildings deemed inadequate, expenditures, progress, and upcoming budgetary needs; under the statutory scheme, the legislature provided for capital construction funding from state wealth without reliance
                        upon local wealth as a source of capital, mandated that facilities be remedied to a point requiring only routine maintenance, and made adequacy of the facilities a function of delivering adequate education programs. The legislature
                        has acted to increase the speed of repair or replacement and continues to appropriate large sums; that continued aggressive legislative oversight over capital construction was obtaining results as part of a constitutional statutory
                        scheme to eliminate wealth-based disparities in the state school system. Campbell County Sch. Dist. v. State, 2008 WY 2, 181 P.3d 43, <cite class="wy_code">2008 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. 2008).

                                of state matching funds may be expended for purposes other than reasonable costs of administration. All expenditures shall be used exclusively for the purposes of the endowment, including reasonable costs of administration.
                                Earnings also may be reinvested to increase the balance of the corpus. Reasonable costs of administration shall not exceed an annual rate of one percent (1%) of the fair value of each state matching fund account held by
                                the foundation that is associated with a substantial endowment gift received by the foundation under W.S. 21-16-902(a)(iii). The costs of administration shall be assessed quarterly at one-fourth (1/4) the annual rate as
                                specified in this subsection or as otherwise specified by law. The fair value of each state matching fund account held by the foundation shall be determined by the foundation as of the last day of the preceding quarter.
                                Any modification of costs of administration allowed shall be effected through a footnote to the University of Wyoming’s general appropriation in the general government appropriations bill or in a 300 section of the general
                                government appropriations bill. Upon the modification of any costs of administration to an amount above one percent (1%), the University of Wyoming foundation shall submit to the joint appropriations interim committee a
                                detailed financial accounting of all costs of administration incurred during the fiscal year;

                        with the goal of being able to make recommendations to the Wyoming legislature for future legislation needed for merit based scholarship programs, to be known as Hathaway scholarship programs, to make undergraduate post secondary
                        education in Wyoming as free as possible to Wyoming high school graduates. The committee is to consider and make recommendations as to: (1) the amount of tuition, fees and other education related payments which can be sustained
                        from anticipated earnings from the student scholarship endowment account at various qualification levels; (2) reentry requirements for students failing to maintain established college grade point average and other requirements;
                        (3) waiver provisions, if any, regarding any entry or continuing scholarship requirements; (4) administrative oversight of the committee; (5) an implementation date for the program, which shall be no later than the first school
                        year after the student scholarship endowment account contains at least $400,000,000; and (6) additional funding of the program. The committee is to report its initial findings and recommendations to the governor, the joint appropriations
                        and joint education interim committees by November 1, 2005 and, if the committee determines modifications to its initial findings and recommendations are appropriate, again by November 1, 2006. Laws 2005, ch. 190, § 5 is repealed

            <p>
                Laws 2006, ch. 36, § 3, states:
            </p>
            <p>
                “(a) The legislature recognizes that eligible institutions will have made substantial scholarship commitments to students who plan to enroll for the fall of 2006 school year by the time this act is enacted into law. Notwithstanding any other provision
                of this act:
            </p>
            <p>
                “(i) For the 2006-2007 school year, any Hathaway scholarship provided under this act, except need based scholarships provided under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c16a13s21-16-1306" target="_self">21-16-1306</a></cite>, shall be
                reduced by the amount of the eligible institution's merit scholarship commitment made to that student for that school year, but the institution shall honor that commitment to the student in accordance with its terms for that year. For
                the 2006-2007 school year, if a student is eligible for a Hathaway scholarship, a student's acceptance of an eligible institution's merit scholarship commitment shall count toward the total eight (8) semesters of eligibility for a Hathaway
                scholarship;
            </p>
            <p>
                “(ii) In subsequent years for students receiving Hathaway scholarships for the 2006-2007 school year to whom eligible institutions made institutional scholarship commitments beyond the 2006-2007 school year, the Hathaway scholarships provided under this
                act shall not be reduced as provided in paragraph (i) of this subsection, but the institution may reduce its annual institutional scholarship commitment to the student by an amount not to exceed the Hathaway scholarship funds provided
                to the student, excluding need based scholarships provided under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c16a13s21-16-1306" target="_self">21-16-1306</a></cite>, so that the Hathaway scholarship supplants and is not an addition
                to the institutional scholarship. To the extent that the institution reduces its scholarship commitments under this paragraph, the institution shall specify the purposes for which those commitments were reallocated in its report required
                under section 4 of this act.
            </p>
            <p>
                “(b) For purposes of this section “scholarship commitment” means an existing scholarship, a scholarship award letter or a scholarship offer made by the eligible institution.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Laws 2006, ch. 36, § 6, states: “The scholarships provided under this act shall begin for students graduating from an eligible high school or a home-based educational program or receiving a GED after April 1, 2006 and shall be provided beginning with
                the fall semester 2006.”
            </p>

                Laws 2006, ch. 36, § 1 and Laws 2006, ch. 70, § 1 both added an Article 13 to Title 21, chapter 16. The article added by ch. 70 has been redesignated as Article 14 in Title 21, chapter 16 by the Wyoming legislative service office.

                        funds where use of abandoned mine land funds was prohibited. The department has submitted applications substituting for the purposes specified in section 339(c)(vi) other university purposes which have been approved for abandoned
                        mine land funds. Pursuant to this approval and process the university has begun substituting block grant funds as authorized and is expected to complete that substitution by June 30, 2013. The legislature ratifies the actions of
                        the department of environmental quality and the university as set forth in this section. The one million five hundred thousand dollars ($1,500,000.00) in substituted block grant funds described in this section shall be deposited
                        to the reclamation and restoration challenge account created by W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t21c16a14s21-16-1402ol1a" target="_self">21-16-1402(a)</a></cite>.”

                <p>
                    Any Wyoming institution of higher education receiving funding from the state of Wyoming shall accept as valid and transferrable any college level credit hour previously completed with an acceptable grade in any other Wyoming institution of higher education.
                    An institution of higher education may decline to accept a credit hour only if there is a lack of demonstrable applicability to the current educational standards of the institution. The length of time since completion of the credit
                    hour, without more, shall not demonstrate a lack of applicability. Each institution of higher education shall establish appropriate policies to implement this section, which shall include an appeals process available to persons who
                    are denied acceptance of a college level credit hour.

    To be body corporate; powers, duties and functions generally.

                <p>
                    The board of trustees and their successors in office constitute a body corporate by the name of “the trustees of the University of Wyoming”. They possess all the powers necessary or convenient to accomplish the objects and perform the duties prescribed
                    by law, and shall have custody of the books, records, buildings and all other property of the university. The board shall elect a chairman, secretary and treasurer, who shall perform the duties prescribed in the bylaws of the board.
                    The treasurer shall execute a bond, with approved sureties in double the sum likely to come into his hands, for the faithful discharge of his duties. The term of office of board officers, their duties severally and the times for holding
                    meetings shall be fixed in the bylaws of the board. A majority of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business but a less number may adjourn from time to time, and all routine business may be entrusted to an executive
                    committee of no fewer than three (3) members subject to such conditions as the bylaws of the board prescribe. The board may from time to time appoint and authorize a person to examine and approve for payment all legal claims against
                    the corporation. The person shall give bond with surety approved by the board, payable to the state of Wyoming in such sum as the board may fix, conditioned for the faithful performance of his duties. A certificate of appointment signed
                    by the chairman and secretary of the board and the bond shall be filed with the state auditor. At each meeting of the board all action taken by the person so appointed subsequent to the immediately preceding board meeting shall be
                    submitted to the board for its approval or disapproval. The actual and necessary traveling expenses of nonresident members in attending the annual meeting of the board may be audited by the auditing committee thereof and paid by warrant
                    on the treasurer out of the general fund of the university.

                        The legislature provided specifically for the method of annexation of a school district to an established community college district by means of an election and did not provide for any school district meeting as a requirement in the process, so notice

                        Every reasonable presumption will be indulged in favor of the validity of a community college district annexation election, and the one asserting that the election is irregular must bear the burden of showing that it is otherwise. Reitveld v. Northern

                        Commission's disapproval of county's application to form district was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious, where, although the expression of findings was deficient in some areas and the financial soundness criterion was
                        partially unsupported, the record sufficiently demonstrated a balance of the applicable criteria. In re Campbell County, 731 P.2d 1174, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 388</cite> (Wyo. 1987).
