The new codification begins with chapter 11. Chapters 8 through 10 have been omitted intentionally. For table of revised and renumbered sections, see Volume 11 of the Wyoming Statutes Annotated.

      Laws 1998, ch. 5, § 5, provides: “The title 39 recodification in this act is the result of the work of a task force appointed by the governor and the legislative management council in 1995. The task force met for the first time in November of 1995 and presented the draft legislation to the joint revenue interim committee in October of 1997.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Laws 1998, ch. 5, § 6, provides: “This act is intended simply as a recodification. The Wyoming legislature intends to make no substantive change to prior law including, but not limited to revenue, either increases or decreases, powers, duties, authorities, obligations, definitions, administration, confidentiality, imposition, tax rates, exemptions, licenses, permits, compliance, collection procedures, enforcement, remedies, statutes of limitation or distribution of taxes. This act is not intended to affect the validity of any rule or regulation promulgated prior to the effective date of this act.”
     </p>
     <p>
      Laws 1998, ch. 5, § 7, provides:
     </p>
     <p>
      “(a) Any other act adopted by the Wyoming legislature during the same session in which this act is adopted shall be given precedence and shall prevail over the amendments in this act to the extent that such acts are in conflict with this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      “(b) The purpose of this act is to conform title 39 and any other title 39 amendments to the format adopted for recodification. The legislative service office is authorized to conform any other bill passed by the legislature during the 1998 special session which amends or references title 39 to the format adopted by this bill.”

        County assessor's valuation of the taxpayer's personal property for ad valorem tax assessments at the taxpayer's coal mines, which were purchased in 1998, was supported by substantial evidence because the assessor's use of the 1998 purchase price, rather than the original cost of the individual items of property, as the starting place for the cost method of appraisal was consistent with the regulations, applicable law, and guidelines, which seemed to direct it. Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c13s39-13-103ol1bii" target="_self">39-13-103(b)(ii)</a></cite> required that property be valued at its fair market value as defined in this section for property tax purposes, and the 1998 purchase price was a much better indicator of what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the property in an arms length transaction.

   The board's allocation of a coal company's reclamation costs to nonmining activities and the board's allowance of a deduction from the taxable value of the coal provided a direct and significant negative impact on the amount of ad valorem and severance taxes collected by the state. The department, as the administrative agency charged with the collection of tax revenues for the state, served as the primary agent of the state in tax matters. Amax Coal Co. v.

         A city-owned building leased to a private corporation in the business of modification, repair, overhaul, conditioning and testing of aircraft, aircraft parts and incidentals for the United States of America and for others was not in use for primarily governmental purposes and was not exempt from taxation by a county.

        <p>
         The city was “primarily” using the property the county wanted to partially tax for the express “governmental purpose” of a city hall even though the city collected rent or rented space to a state agency. Permitting the county to tax the secondary use of the property would impose a burden on the people of this state which the specific language of our constitution and laws prohibit.

         A “fixed base operation” is a necessary adjunct to the operation of an airport. That being true, it reasonably follows that city-owned buildings leased for use in such an operation were “used primarily for a governmental purpose” within the reach of the constitutional provision and the exemption statute. Consequently, no part of those buildings was subject to county taxation. City of Cheyenne v. Board of County Comm'rs, 484 P.2d 706, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 215</cite> (Wyo. 1971).

        <p>
         A city-owned building leased to an ambulance service, which although subsidized by both the city and county rendered a county-wide ambulance service for which it made charges to users of the service, but which made only three percent (3%) of its service calls in response to airport accidents or contemplated accidents, was not exempt from taxation by the county as municipal property which is part of an airport.

        <p>
         The framers of the state constitution and the legislatures of the state which enacted the laws exempting property from taxation did not intend that a person whose property would ordinarily be subject to taxation should be released from bearing his share of the expense of government by simply leasing his property for a substantial rental to an association which, due to the purposes for which it was organized, is exempted from paying taxes when using property for those purposes. When a person derives income from property in such fashion he is using it for his own personal advantage and there is no valid reason why he should not pay the taxes regularly assessed to it. Commissioners of Cambria Park v. Board of County Comm'rs, 62 Wyo. 446, 174 P.2d 402, <cite class="wy_code">1946 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1946).
        </p>
        <p>
         Real estate of a nonprofit corporation leased to a nonprofit religious corporation for school or religious purposes was not exempt from taxation on the ground that it was not used for “private profit” where under the lease the lessee was required to pay the taxes on the real estate amounting to $500 a year and was also required to place improvements on the real estate each year in the amount of $500 and thus the lessor gained a benefit in the amount of $1,000 a year.

        <p>
         When a trustee asserted the trustee's trusts were charitable trusts and the trusts' property was exempt from taxation, the trustee's complaint was properly dismissed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine because county assessors had primary responsibility for making such determinations pursuant to a fact intensive investigation under Department of Revenue rules.

       To satisfy the fourth requirement for being classified as agricultural land, taxpayers had to present credible evidence that each parcel was used or employed consistent with the land’s size, location, and capability to produce, primarily in an agricultural operation; taxpayers presented testimony on the association’s overall operations but failed to present specific evidence demonstrating the association’s actual use of each parcel and how that use satisfied the statutory requirement. Helmut J. Mueller L.P. v. Treanor, 2018 WY 131, 430 P.3d 733, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 135</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the assessor failed to present evidence that the properties were not fully utilized was immaterial because the burden was on the taxpayers to overcome the presumption in favor of the assessor, and there was no substantial evidence to support the county board’s conclusion that taxpayers met the statutory requirements. Helmut J. Mueller L.P. v. Treanor, 2018 WY 131, 430 P.3d 733, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 135</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxpayers presented no evidence to support the county board’s assumption that each parcel’s lease revenue directly corresponded to and evidenced the extent of its agricultural production, and thus the county board’s calculations could not support its conclusion that taxpayers satisfied the statutory requirements.

       Where a property is only offered to dealers using sealed bids and the value paid by the successful bidder is grossly disproportionate to the assessed value (accounting for depreciation), fair value is not established by the sale, and the assessor may disregard the sale price in favor of other proper criteria used to determine fair value.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c13s39-13-108ol1bii" target="_self">39-13-108(b)(ii)</a></cite> was interest rather than penalty because court could not determine how much, if any, of rate was used to coerce compliance or to punish noncompliant taxpayer.

Unlike other statutes, Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c13s39-13-108ol1ev" target="_self">39-13-108(e)(v)</a></cite> does not specifically refer to Wyo. R. Civ. P. 4 in establishing the framework for serving the requisite notice; and even if Rule 4 applied, the purchaser did not comply with Rule 4 because the sheriff's deputy did not deliver the notice to the owner personally, leave it at his usual place of business, or at his dwelling house.

       There is no subsection (i) or (l) in this section as it appears in the printed act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws 2009, ch. 153, § 2, provides: “(a) The legislature finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i) There are in Wyoming extensive reserves of natural gas which contain helium, much of which underlie lands which are owned by the United States, and the leases of the natural gas by the federal government under laws which are now obsolete and outdated operate in a fashion which allows the producer of the helium to avoid ad valorem taxation, but retain the right to produce, market and sell the helium and retain revenue from the sale of the helium;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii) All helium producers in this state should be taxed in the same manner;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii) Under certain unique circumstances, more particularly described in
       <i>
        Department of Revenue v. Exxon Mobil Corporation
       </i>
       , 162 P.3d 515 (Wyo. 2007), natural gas is leased to an oil and gas producer, reserving the title to the helium component of the natural gas in the United States; however, the producer takes possession of the natural gas, transports, processes, extracts the helium from the gas stream and sells the helium, and the title to the helium first passes to the producer downstream of the point of valuation, thus allowing helium to avoid ad valorem taxation;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iv) These circumstances occur in cases in which the federal lease is issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, 30 U.S.C. section 181, which requires that the United States reserve “the ownership of and the right to extract helium from all gas produced from lands leased or otherwise granted,” and title to the helium is passed pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement, or contract, as opposed to a federal lease;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(v) From and after the effective date of the Helium Privatization Act of 1996, 50 U.S.C. section 167a, the United States may lease helium as it does any other mineral rendering helium production subject to state taxation; however, the value of the helium gross product removed, extracted, produced and sold which is produced in the natural gas stream leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, avoids ad valorem taxation, and thus is treated differently than other components of natural gas produced within the state of Wyoming;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vi) Production of helium containing natural gas leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 should be treated similarly to the production of helium leased pursuant to the Helium Privatization Act of 1996, or helium produced from nonfederal lands with regard to ad valorem taxation;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vii) It is the intent of the legislature that the tax be imposed on either the person who owns the mineral, or the person who owns the right to produce, remove or sell the mineral by lease or other contractual right, but that no mineral be subject to double ad valorem taxation. The Wyoming constitution, article 15, section 3, provides that the minerals which are “or may be produced” shall be taxed on the “gross product thereof, as may be prescribed by law.” Under certain unique circumstances, more particularly described in
       <i>
        Department of Revenue v. Exxon Mobil Corporation
       </i>
       , 162 P.3d 515 (Wyo. 2007), certain helium produced avoids ad valorem taxation because it is produced by contract and not a lease, which decision does not reflect the intent of the legislature with regard to helium;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(viii) Helium within natural gas leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is a valuable deposit, but its production avoids taxation in violation of the requirements of Wyoming constitution, article 15, section 3, and taxation statutes enacted pursuant thereto;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ix) It is the intent of the legislature that the state of Wyoming should encourage the United States government to lease helium as it does other minerals.”

      <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1a">
       Commencing with mineral and mine production on January 1, 2020, this section shall govern the payment of all ad valorem taxes on the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products, hereafter referred to as the “ad valorem tax on mineral production”. Any provisions of this title related to the ad valorem tax on mineral production that do not conform to the processes and procedures set forth in this section are superseded by this section to the extent the procedures conflict with this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1b">
       Except as provided in this section, all mineral and mine producers in the state shall report and pay the ad valorem tax on mineral production for each county on a monthly basis. Payments shall be due and payable to the department on or before the twenty-fifth day of the second month following the month of production. Payments under this subsection shall not be less than the amount calculated by the taxpayer by applying the mill levy rate established by the county in the immediately preceding year to the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products produced each month. Annually, on or before September 20, the county treasurer shall send a written statement to each taxpayer by mail at his last known address or, if offered by the county and upon request of the taxpayer, by electronic transmission, of any tax due or overpayment received after applying the amount the county has received from that taxpayer through monthly payments under this section by reconciling those payments with the applicable mill levy rate for that production year, itemized as to property description, assessed value and applicable mill levies. Failure to send notice, or to demand payment of taxes, does not invalidate any taxes due. The taxpayer shall reconcile the amount indicated on the notice as follows:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1bi">
         If the statement provided by the county indicates additional taxes are due, the taxpayer shall pay the additional amount due not later than December 20 of that year;
        </li>
        <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1bii">
         If the statement by the county indicates that the monthly payments resulted in an overpayment of the taxes, the county treasurer shall refund taxes that were overpaid under this section by December 20 of that year. The taxpayer may elect to have the county treasurer retain any overpayment amount and apply that amount towards other ad valorem taxes due.

      <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1c">
       Collection and distribution. Monthly and annual payments of the ad valorem tax on mineral production shall be collected by the department on behalf of each county. The department shall properly account for the payments received and distribute the payments monthly to the county treasurer. Upon distribution of funds to counties under this subsection the amount shall be proportionally distributed by the county treasurer to each taxing entity within the county as provided in W.S. 39-13-111.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1d">
       If a taxpayer’s liability for severance tax as imposed under chapter 14 of this title is less than thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) for the preceding calendar year, the monthly payment requirements for the ad valorem tax on mineral production under this chapter are waived and the taxpayer shall report and pay the ad valorem tax on mineral production annually as provided in this subsection. The annual report and payment shall be due and payable on February 25 of the year following the year of production. Annual payments shall be calculated by the taxpayer by applying the mill levy rate established by the county commissioners in the production year, along with any adjustments made in accordance with law and reported by the county to the department by January 15 of the year following the production year, to the value of the gross product of minerals and mine products produced in the applicable year. Annual payments made under this subsection shall be paid to the department and deposited with the applicable county treasurer as provided in subsection (c) of this section and reconciled as provided in subsection (b) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t39c13s39-13-113ol1e">
       Failure to make payments at the time they are due and payable under this section shall subject the taxpayer to the enforcement provisions of W.S. 39-13-108 and shall also be subject to enforcement as follows:

       Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (f) of this section, estimated monthly ad valorem tax payments shall first be due under this section beginning with production on January 1, 2022. The ad valorem tax on mineral production from calendar years 2020 and 2021 shall be paid as provided in this subsection. Fifty percent (50%) of taxes due for production from calendar year 2020 shall be due on and after September 1, 2021 and payable to the counties on and after November 10, 2021. Unless the entire tax due for production from calendar year 2020 is paid by December 31, 2021, the remaining fifty percent (50%) of the taxes due for production from calendar year 2020 and all taxes due from production in calendar year 2021 shall be paid as provided in this subsection. The total amount of 2020 and 2021 remaining taxes due under this subsection shall be calculated by the department and the applicable counties. The taxpayer shall make an additional payment on December 1 of each year beginning in 2023 equal to eight percent (8%) of the total amount calculated under this subsection until the total amount has been paid. Timely payments made in accordance with this subsection shall not be subject to penalties or interest. If a taxpayer fails to make timely payments under this subsection, all applicable penalties and interest shall be calculated from the date the tax would have been paid if monthly payments began January 1, 2020.

       The Wyoming state board of equalization did not err in affirming the department of revenue's determination that the petitioner's road move expenses incurred during coal production years 1990-1992 were direct mining costs rather than indirect costs for the purposes of valuing the petitioner's coal production during those same years as the expenses at issue were, by agreement of the parties, specifically attributable to the mining operation rather than general and administrative costs which could not be specifically attributed to an operational function without allocation.

       The term “direct mining costs” under subparagraph (b)(vii)(B) was not intended to include such expenses as a bonus payment required for the purchase of the coal lease; had the legislature intended to include costs not associated with the actual act of mining, it would have done so expressly and not by the use of a catch-all phrase that follows a very detailed list of costs incurred in the physical act of mining. Powder River Coal Co. v. Wyo. State Bd. of Equalization, 2002 WY 5, 38 P.3d 423, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 2002), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo.

      </p>
      <p>
       A lease bonus in federal coal lease was not a royalty nor was it a direct mining cost as contemplated by the statute and regulations; the legislature intended for bonus payments to be treated as an indirect cost benefiting the entire operation. Powder River Coal Co. v. Wyo. State Bd. of Equalization, 2002 WY 5, 38 P.3d 423, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 2002), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-103" target="_self">39-14-103</a></cite> is the work necessary to accomplish the act of mining, and Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-101ol1av" target="_self">39-14-101(a)(v)</a></cite> (2005) defines mining or production as drilling, blasting, loading, roadwork, overburden removal, pre-mouth of the mine reclamation, transportation from the point of severance to the mouth of the mine, and maintenance of facilities and equipment directly relating to any of the functions stated in the paragraph. Thus, whatever it costs the employer to obtain the necessary work to accomplish the mining is the cost of labor, and wages are a component of the direct cost of labor; “mining labor” in the context of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-103" target="_self">39-14-103</a></cite> is not a term of art and does not mean only actual hourly wage or salary paid and nothing else.

       When all the provisions of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-103" target="_self">39-14-103</a></cite> are read together, the legislature simply means all costs, a portion of which are directly associated with a particular function, should be attributed to that function in some reasonable way; the indirect cost catch-all phrase in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-103ol1bviiD" target="_self">39-14-103(b)(vii)(D)</a></cite>, other general and administrative costs which cannot be specifically attributed to an operational function without allocation, simply means costs similar to those specifically listed which are not directly related to a function and, therefore, must be allocated by the direct cost formula. The words “without allocation” in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a01s39-14-103ol1bviiD" target="_self">39-14-103(b)(vii)(D)</a></cite> are not intended to prevent costs directly associated with a particular function from being considered as direct costs simply because they had to be allocated among the functions by some agreed upon formula, either because of the level of detail provided by the taxpayer's accounting system or because of the nature of the cost; the more reasonable interpretation of that language suggests the catch-all phrase means other costs similar in nature to the listed indirect costs and for which no reasonable formula exists to allocate those costs among functions except the direct cost ratio.

       The processes necessary for production of gas, for severance and ad valorem tax purposes, are those necessary to sever or remove the gas from the well and those processes which are not necessary to remove the gas from the well are post-production expenses. This includes compression which is not necessary to remove gas from the well. Chevron U.S.A. v. State, 918 P.2d 980, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo.

       When a taxpayer undervalues its oil and gas gross production, the underpaid ad valorem tax is delinquent on the date it should have been paid, not on the later date of notification and demand. Assessing interest only from the date of notification and demand would permit the taxpayer to undervalue gross production without risk of penalty and would allow the taxpayer the free use of the unpaid tax dollars.

      <p>
       In a contested case proceeding, the State Board of Equalization violated the natural gas processing and production company's procedural due process rights in an administrative proceeding by depriving the company of an opportunity to participate. The board remanded the case to the department of revenue for adoption of a more determinative formula for computation of comparable value based upon reasonable inferences from third-party natural gas processing fees without allowing the company to participate. Because the formula depended upon factual ascertainment in order to properly compute those taxes, the nonparticipating company was deprived of its due process rights. Amoco Prod. Co. v. Wyoming State Bd. of Equalization, 882 P.2d 866, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 115</cite> (Wyo. 1994).

       Wyoming Department of Revenue properly reallocated a production company's oil production from a production unit for 1980 through 1988 between one county and intervenor county because former Wyo. Stat.

       Where corporation with federal oil and gas leases produced natural gas from deep wells, and the composition of the natural gas stream produced from these deep wells was .6 percent helium, district court properly determined that severance and ad valorem taxes did not apply to the .6 percent helium, due to the unique circumstances created by Congress'

      <p>
       Debtor's hedges were financial swap contracts that were purely financial, derivative transactions meant to protect debtor from the volatility of the oil and gas markets; thus, because the hedges did not affect the market value of the gas at the well or on the leased property or generate any profits from actual production at the wellhead, the gains or losses were not included in the computation of plaintiffs' net profits interest. This reading of the contract was consistent with Wyoming law regarding imposition of severance taxes on oil and gas production. Hartman v. Ultra Petro. Corp. (In re Ultra Petro.

        Point of valuation of custody transfer meters. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Custody transfer meter is an official measurer of gas as it passes from one entity to another for the other's immediate charge or control under this section, and the type of meter does not determine whether custody is being transferred at the meter. The Wyoming Department of Revenue's decision that the point of valuation was at an inlet to a compressor was affirmed because a taxpayer was unable to meet its burden of proof of showing that volume meters at certain wellheads were custody transfer meters. Amoco Prod. Co. v. Dep't of Revenue, 2004 WY 89, 94 P.3d 430, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       State Board of Equalization did not err in finding that meters on an oil company's natural gas wells were not “custody transfer meters” under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a02s39-14-203ol1biv" target="_self">39-14-203(b)(iv)</a></cite>, and therefore not proper tax valuation points for the oil company's gas production, because the oil company retained custody and control over the natural gas both before and after it passed through the meters; the definitional requirement that the gas pass from one entity to another for the other's immediate charge or control was therefore not met.

       Standard volumetric production payment (VPP) was a financing agreement, but the corporation's VPP transaction included a series of exchanges for terms equivalent to cash based upon index pricing that produced an arm's length sale, and the point of valuation for the sale required application of the statute; however, that error was not brought to the Department of Revenue or Board of Equalization's attention until well after the audit, such that the error was de minimis and not required to remand for a recalculation.

       Wyoming Department of Revenue properly reallocated a production company's oil production from a production unit for 1980 through 1988 between one county and intervenor county because former Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c02a02s39-2-201ol1e" target="_self">39-2-201(e)</a></cite> always contemplated that reporting of oil production should be done at the wellhead, and the enactment of former Wyo.

        Legislative intent.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Laws 2008, ch. 59, § 2, states as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(a)
   The legislature finds that:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i)
   There are in Wyoming extensive reserves of natural gas which contain helium, much of which underlie lands which are owned by the United States, and the leases of the natural gas by the federal government under laws which are now obsolete and outdated operate in a fashion which allows the producer to avoid taxation for the privilege of removing, extracting, severing or producing the helium;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii)
   All helium producers in this state should be taxed in the same manner;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii)
   Under certain unique circumstances, more particularly described in
       <i>
        Department of Revenue v. Exxon Mobil Corporation,
       </i>
       162 P.3d 515 (Wyo. 2007), natural gas is leased to an oil and gas producer, reserving the title to the helium component of the natural gas in the United States; however, the producer takes possession of the natural gas, transports, processes and extracts the helium from the gas stream, and the title to the helium first passes to the producer downstream of the point of valuation;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iv)
   These circumstances occur in cases in which the federal lease is issued pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920,
   30 U.S.C. section 181, which requires that the United States reserve ‘the ownership of and the right to extract helium from all gas produced from lands leased or otherwise granted,’ and title to the helium is passed pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement, as opposed to a federal lease;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(v)
   From and after the effective date of the Helium Privatization Act of 1996,
   50 U.S.C. section 167a, the United States may lease helium as it does any other mineral rendering helium production subject to state taxation; however, the removal, extraction, severance and production of helium which is leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, avoids taxation by the state of Wyoming, and thus is treated differently than all other components of natural gas produced within the state of Wyoming;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vi)
   Production of helium-containing natural gas leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 should be treated similarly to the production of helium leased pursuant to the Helium Privatization Act of 1996, or helium produced from nonfederal lands with regard to taxation by the state of Wyoming;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vii)
   The severance tax is defined multiple times in Title 39, Chapter 14, as ‘an excise tax imposed on the present and continuing privilege of removing, extracting, severing or producing any mineral in this state.’
   It is the intent of the legislature that the tax be imposed on either the person who physically removes, extracts or severs the mineral from the ground, or the person who owns the right to do so, but that no mineral be subject to double taxation.
   To that extent the decision in
       <i>
        Lance Oil & Gas Co. v. Wyoming Department of Revenue
       </i>
       ,
   101 P.3d 899 (Wyo. 2004), does not reflect the intent of the legislature with regard to the imposition of the severance tax; however, in the case of all other minerals produced in this state, the holding did not allow minerals other than helium produced pursuant to leases issued under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 to avoid taxation;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(viii)
   Helium within natural gas leased pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 is a valuable deposit, but its production avoids taxation in violation of the requirements of
   Wyoming constitution, article 15, sections 3 and
   19, and taxation statutes enacted pursuant thereto.”

       Wyoming Department of Revenue properly reallocated a production company's oil production from a production unit for 1980 through 1988 between one county and intervenor county because former Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c02a02s39-2-201ol1e" target="_self">39-2-201(e)</a></cite> always contemplated that reporting of oil production should be done at the wellhead, and the enactment of former Wyo. Stat. Ann § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c02a02s39-2-213" target="_self">39-2-213</a></cite> (currently Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c14a02s39-14-207ol1aiii" target="_self">39-14-207(a)(iii)</a></cite>) did not constitute a ‘change,’ but only a restatement of what general practice had always been contemplated, the practice that was generally in place, and the practice that should generally continue.

           For bentonite sold away from the mouth of the mine, the taxable value shall be calculated by adding to each producer’s actual direct cost of mining per unit, an allocation of indirect costs, overhead and profit, per unit, as determined by the method prescribed in subdivision (I) of this subparagraph plus nonexempt royalty and production taxes per unit:
           <ol type="I">

             The allocation of indirect costs, overhead and profit, shall be determined initially and effective with the implementation of this section, by first calculating a bentonite industry wide percentage add-on factor, determined as prescribed in subdivision (II) of this subparagraph, and second by multiplying this initial industry factor times each producer’s actual average direct mining costs to mine-mouth per unit, excluding royalty and production taxes. This add-on amount shall be computed prospectively for each producer each year as prescribed in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph;

            <li id="t39c14a04s39-14-403ol1bivAII">
             The industry factor shall initially be determined by an audit of 1989 production data conducted in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (IV) of this subparagraph. The initial industry factor shall be the same for all producers for 1990 which shall represent the base line year. The subsequent add-on factors for each producer will be determined each year as defined in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph;

             Subsequent adjustments to the add-on amount as initially determined under the provisions of subdivision (II) of this subparagraph and as subsequently determined under the provisions of this subdivision shall be recalculated each year with the base year being the initial year of this act. The recalculated add-on amount per unit for each producer shall be determined by multiplying the previous, or initial, add-on percentage amount by the difference between each individual bentonite producer’s percentage increase or decrease in mining costs per unit from the percentage increase or decrease in sales price per unit and then adding this amount to the initial industry wide or previous percentage add-on factor. Sales price per unit for purposes of this formula shall be the weighted average sales price per unit for each producer based on the actual arms-length sales of milled bentonite used for taconite, foundry and drilling mud applications (including crushed and dried shipments), where user destinations are known to be in the United States and Canada. Packaged sales of bentonite in these three (3) categories shall be included after deducting the packaging premium. The packaging premium shall be calculated by subtracting the weighted average sales price per ton of bulk sales in these three (3) categories from the weighted average sales price per ton of package sales in these three (3) categories. If substantial arms-length transactions, which are at least five percent (5%) of total transactions in a particular category, do not exist for a producer in a specific targeted sales category, average pricing determined from arms-length transactions in that specific category by all producers shall be imposed. In no event shall the value of the bentonite product include any processing functions or operations regardless of where the processing is performed. As used in this subsection, direct mining costs include but are not limited to mining labor including mine foremen and supervisory personnel whose primary responsibility is extraction of bentonite, supplies used for mining, mining equipment, fuel, power and other utilities used for mining, maintenance of mining equipment, depreciation of mining equipment, reclamation, ad valorem property taxes on mining equipment, transportation of bentonite from the point of severance to the point of valuation and any other costs incurred prior to the point of valuation that are directly and specifically attributable to the mining operation. Royalty and production taxes shall be excluded from mine mouth cost for purposes of computation. In no event and under no circumstances shall the value of bentonite be less than the direct mining costs plus nonexempt royalty and production taxes;

             At four (4) year intervals and for the base year the taxable value per unit for each producer shall be revised using the proportionate profits method. Each producer’s add-on factor shall be adjusted to provide the taxable value equivalent to the value derived using the proportionate profits method with a direct cost ratio. The direct cost ratio shall be total direct mining costs divided by total direct mining, processing and transportation costs. The sales price per unit, as described in subdivision (III) of this subparagraph, shall exclude all royalties and production taxes. The taxable value shall be derived based on an audit of the most current completed year’s data conducted in the producer’s offices. Should the audit not be performed, the producer’s factor shall be adjusted according to subdivision (III) of this subparagraph until the audit is performed, and then the revised factor shall be applied prospectively. Thereafter, the revised factor for each producer shall be adjusted according to subdivision (III) of this subparagraph.

       Wyoming Department of Revenue properly reallocated a production company's oil production from a production unit for 1980 through 1988 between one county and intervenor county because former Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c02a02s39-2-201ol1e" target="_self">39-2-201(e)</a></cite> always contemplated that reporting of oil production should be done at the wellhead, and the enactment of former Wyo.

If the report the taxpayer is required to file shows tax due, the taxpayer shall pay the tax due when the report is filed. The department may allow extensions for paying taxes by regulation. The department may, if an extension is granted, request the payment of the reasonable estimate of ninety percent (90%) of the tax by the statutory due date, with the remaining tax remitted with the extended return;

        Agreement to allocate tax burdens. —

      <p>
       Plaintiffs may have been correct that the government would hold only defendant, not plaintiffs, liable for severance and ad valorem taxes. But plaintiffs and defendant agreed to allocate the tax burdens differently, and that agreement was valid and enforceable between the parties, even though the agreement might not have been binding on the government.

When an increase in the value of any product is subject to the approval of any agency of the United States of America or the state of Wyoming, or of any court, the increased value shall be subject to property taxation. In the event the increase in value is disapproved, either in whole or in part, then the amount of tax which has been paid on the disapproved part of the value shall be considered excess tax.

     The rule that points raised for first time in petition for rehearing will ordinarily not be considered is especially applicable in cases questioning constitutionality of a statute, and it was so applied where constitutionality of this article was first questioned on petition for rehearing. Walgreen Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 62 Wyo. 288, 166 P.2d 960, <cite class="wy_code">1946 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 1946).

    <p>
     Though the 1935 Sales Tax Act expired the day before the 1937 act for the same purpose became effective, the latter must be regarded in many respects as amendatory of the earlier law. State v. Holly Sugar Corp., 57 Wyo. 272, 116 P.2d 847, <cite class="wy_code">1941 Wyo. LEXIS 31</cite> (Wyo. 1941).

     Use tax is complementary to sales tax;
   
   the sales of goods bought outside state and brought into state is put on equal footing with goods subject to the sales tax. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 58 Wyo. 500, 135 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

      Retroactive change in rule unlawful. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     A rule of the board (now department) which was operative as early as 1937 declared that where personal property was purchased from a retailer without Wyoming and shipped by him directly to a customer in this state, the receipts from such a sale were not taxable under the sales tax but were subject to the use tax. Since the rule represented the board's interpretation of the statutes and had been in force for over a decade, a foreign company was entitled to rely on it in formulating business policies, and it would be unlawful and unfair for the board to establish retroactively a contrary policy. Hercules Powder Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 66 Wyo. 268, 208 P.2d 1096, <cite class="wy_code">1949 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1949).
    </p>
    <p>
     Taxpayer cannot escape liability for penalties due on sales taxes
   
   on ground that it acted in good faith in questioning by court proceedings tax involved, because the statute makes no exception. State v. Holly Sugar Corp., 57 Wyo. 272, 116 P.2d 847, <cite class="wy_code">1941 Wyo. LEXIS 31</cite> (Wyo. 1941).

       Department of revenue was not authorized to assess interest and penalties against purchasers for delinquent sales taxes. State v. Bannon Energy Corp., 999 P.2d 1306, <cite class="wy_code">2000 Wyo. LEXIS 59</cite> (Wyo. 2000).

      </p>
      <p>
       Sales tax exemption did not apply to a Utah company; there was no violation of the Commerce Clause since the taxpayer's connection to Wyoming was substantially more than the shipping of goods by a non-resident seller, and the taxpayer had a tax license and collected taxes on similar transactions. Moreover, the shipments to customers in Wyoming constituted taxable destination sales where the evidence showed a delivery address in Wyoming, inspection took place at the destination point, Utah taxes were not collected, and Wyoming taxes had been collected in similar cases.

Effective  July 1, 1997, a license fee of sixty dollars ($60.00) shall be required  from each new vendor, except for any remote vendor who has no requirement  to register in this state, or who is using one (1) of the technology  models pursuant to the streamlined sales and use tax agreement. Failure  of a vendor to timely file any return may result in forfeiture of  the license granted under this section. The department shall charge  sixty dollars ($60.00) for reinstatement of any forfeited license.  The department shall send any vendor who reports no gross sales for  three (3) consecutive years a form prescribed by the department to  show cause why the vendor’s license should not be revoked.  The vendor shall complete and file the report with the department  within thirty (30) days of receipt of the form. If the department  finds just cause for the vendor to retain the license, no further  action shall be taken. If the department finds just cause to revoke  the license, the vendor shall be notified of the revocation. Any vendor  whose license is revoked under this subsection may appeal the decision  to the state board of equalization as  provided in subsection (g) of this section.

         Each vendor shall on or before the last day of each month file a true return showing the preceding month’s gross sales and remit all taxes to the department. The returns shall contain such information and be made in the manner as the department by regulation prescribes. The department may allow extensions for filing returns and paying the taxes by regulation, but no extension may be for more than ninety (90) days. If the total tax to be remitted by a vendor during any month is less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), a quarterly or annual return as authorized by the department, and remittance in lieu of the monthly return may be made on or before the last day of the month following the end of the quarter or year for which the tax is collected. If the accounting methods regularly used by any vendor are such that reports of sales made during a calendar month would impose unnecessary hardships, the department after receiving a formal request filed by the vendor may accept reports at intervals as would be more convenient to the taxpayer. Any vendor shall report whether the vendor sells nicotine products, as defined by W.S. 39-18-101(a)(xi), in this state to the department in the form and manner required by the department. The department may reject any report required under this paragraph of any vendor who does not comply with the nicotine sales reporting requirements. Every person purchasing goods or services taxable by this article who does not pay the tax owed to a vendor shall, on or before the last day of each month, file a return showing the gross purchases made during the preceding month and remit all taxes due to the department. The return shall contain such information and be made in the manner as the department shall prescribe by rule and regulation. The department, by rule and regulation, may allow an extension for filing a return and paying any tax due, but no extension shall be granted for more than ninety (90) days;

If any account is thereafter collected by the vendor, a tax shall be paid upon the amount collected. The amount collected shall be applied proportionally first to the taxable price of the property or service and the sales tax thereon, and then to interest, service charges and any other charges. Should the bad debt exceed the taxable sales for a subsequent period the vendor may request a refund of the tax on the bad debt from the department so long as the claim is made within three (3) years of the date of the return on which the bad debt could first be claimed. A certified service provider under W.S. 39-15-401 through 39-15-408 acting on behalf of a vendor may claim the bad debt allowance for the vendor and shall remit the credit or refund received to the vendor. Should the bad debt apply to more than one (1) state, the debt may be allocated between the affected states.

      <p>
       A business erroneously collected sales tax from its customers and remitted the same to the state, and was assessed sales and use tax on materials consumed by it as a contractor. No payment was made on the assessment, but, instead, a hearing was held by the board on the business's contention that it was entitled to a credit for the sales tax it collected, with a subsequent appeal to the district court. The court was without subject matter jurisdiction for the following reasons: (1) the aggrieved party was statutorily required to pay all taxes prior to appealing the decision; and (2) the money collected from the customers belonged to third parties and could not qualify as payment of the business's taxes.

        How interest and penalty accrue. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest and penalty for failure to pay sales and use taxes accrue, not by reason of assessment by board of equalization (now department), but by virtue of tax statutes, and taxpayers are not relieved from penalties and interest on amount actually due. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 58 Wyo. 500, 135 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 1943).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provision for interest is separate from that for penalty
   
   and only the latter is nonassessable unless nonpayment of tax is due to negligence or intentional disregard of rules. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 58 Wyo. 500, 135 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

        Interest not chargeable where hearing wrongfully denied. —
       </b>

       Where court held use and sales taxpayers were wrongfully denied hearing on amount due, no interest could be charged on assessment from time hearing was refused to time it was finally had. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 58 Wyo. 500, 135 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

        Elimination of penalty where good faith contest. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where taxpayer unsuccessfully but in good faith contended sales tax was not due on sales to nonresidents and reasonable question had existed whether rules were applicable, the penalty had to be eliminated from the assessment. Morrison-Knudson Co. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 58 Wyo. 500, 135 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

        No credit against business's liability resulting from overpayment of taxes by customers. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A business erroneously collected sales tax from its customers and remitted the same to the state, and was assessed sales and use tax on materials consumed by it as a contractor. When the state failed to provide a credit under this section for the sales tax collected, a declaratory judgment action was brought. Such an action was improper, however, as the case did not concern the constitutionality or interpretation of this section, which is not concerned with the granting of credit against a person's liability through the application of moneys resulting from overpayment by third parties.

       The federal Miller Act (40 USCS § 270a); now see 40 USCS § 3131 requires a federal contractor to post a payment bond and mandates that every suit instituted under the act “shall be brought … in the United States District Court … and not elsewhere.” An action under this section, however, is quite simply not a suit on the bond, nor is the action based directly on the bond, and it is not a suit seeking recovery out of the bond, but rather, it is a suit to enforce an independent statutory obligation placed on all those who act as sureties on performance bonds for any nonresident prime contractor, a tax obligation squarely within the permissible parameters of federal statutory and constitutional law.

The audit shall be completed by the department of audit with final findings issued to the taxpayer or vendor within one (1) year of the date of the notice of engagement. This time limit may be extended only upon mutual agreement between the taxpayer or vendor and the department;

        Business's erroneous collection of taxes from customers not subject to judicial review. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A business erroneously collected sales tax from its customers and remitted the same to the state, and was assessed sales and use tax on materials consumed by it as a contractor. No payment was made on the assessment, but, instead, a hearing was held by the board on the business's contention that it was entitled to a credit for the sales tax it collected, with a subsequent appeal to the district court. The court was without subject matter jurisdiction for the following reasons: (1) the aggrieved party was statutorily required to pay all taxes prior to appealing the decision; and (2) the money collected from the customers belonged to third parties and could not qualify as payment of the business's taxes.

Each payment to the county treasurer shall be equal to an amount determined by the industrial siting council under this subsection and shall continue during the period of construction except that in the case of an industrial facility or a federal or state government project which is expected to continue in phases for an indefinite period of time, the department of revenue shall discontinue payments under this section when construction of any phase has ceased or been substantially completed for twelve (12) consecutive months. The person constructing the industrial facility and the counties affected by the construction of the industrial facility shall provide evidence at the public hearing held pursuant to W.S. 35-12-110(f)(i) of the mitigated and unmitigated impacts that the construction will have on the counties, cities and towns determined by the industrial siting council to be affected by the construction of the industrial facility.

Under no circumstances shall the impact assistance payment exceed two and seventy-six hundredths percent (2.76%) of the total estimated material costs of the facility, as those costs are determined by the council. The impact assistance payments shall be distributed to the county treasurer and the county treasurer will distribute to the county and to the cities and towns therein based on a ratio established by the industrial siting council during a public hearing held in accordance with W.S. 35-12-110(f)(i). The industrial siting council shall review the distribution ratio for construction projects on a regular basis and make appropriate adjustments. A governing body which is primarily affected by the facility, or any person issued a permit pursuant to W.S. 35-12-106, may petition the industrial siting council for review and adjustment of the distribution ratio or the amount of the impact assistance payment upon a showing of good cause. The impact assistance payment shall be in addition to all other distributions under this section, but no impact assistance payment shall be made for any period in which the county or counties are not imposing at least a one percent (1%) tax authorized by W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) and 39-16-204(a)(i) or at least a total of a two percent (2%) sales tax authorized under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i), (iii) and (vi) and at least a total of a two percent (2%) use tax authorized under W.S. 39-16-204(a)(i), (ii) and (v). For purposes of this subsection, the industrial facility or federal or state government project will be deemed to be located in the county in which a majority of the construction costs will be expended, provided that upon a request from the county commissioners of an adjoining county to the industrial siting council, the council may determine that the social and economic impacts from construction of the industrial facility or federal or state government project upon the adjoining county are significant and establish the ratio of impacts between the counties and certify that ratio to the department of revenue who will thereafter distribute the impact assistance payment to the counties pursuant to that ratio.

       Laws 2008, ch. 15, § 2, provides: “This act is intended to clarify the effect of 2007 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 133.

       The federal Miller Act (40 USCS § 270a) requires a federal contractor to post a payment bond and mandates that every suit instituted under the act “shall be brought … in the United States District Court … and not elsewhere.” An action under this section, however, is quite simply not a suit on the bond, nor is the action based directly on the bond, and it is not a suit seeking recovery out of the bond, but rather, it is a suit to enforce an independent statutory obligation placed on all those who act as sureties on performance bonds for any nonresident prime contractor, a tax obligation squarely within the permissible parameters of federal statutory and constitutional law.

      This chapter, which derived from
   Laws 2000, ch. 102, § 1, related to the excise tax on commercial transportation of coal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Laws 2004, ch. 1, § 2, makes the act effective immediately upon completion of all acts necessary for a bill to become law as provided by art. 4, § 8, Wyo. Const. Approved March 1, 2004.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the chapter's repeal by Laws 2004, ch. 1, § 1, Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. v. Atwood, 271 F. Supp. 2d 1359, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17079 (D. Wyo. 2003) had held that the Wyoming Coal Transportation Tax under §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c21s39-21-101" target="_self">39-21-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t39c21s39-21-111" target="_self">39-21-111</a></cite> singled out the railroads for the imposition of a tax that was not generally applicable to other commercial and industrial taxpayers and that tax resulted in a discriminatory treatment of common carriers by rail; the fact that it also applied to a very small number of other taxpayers who paid considerably less than one percent of the tax did not diminish that fact. Therefore, because the Coal Transportation Tax violated the provisions of § 306(1)(d) of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, 49 U.S.C.S. § 11501, which prohibits the imposition of any other tax which results in discriminatory treatment of a common carrier by rail, the Wyoming Department of Revenue was enjoined from assessing, levying, or collecting the Coal Transportation Tax.
