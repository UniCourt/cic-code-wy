            (Framed by a constitutional convention which met in Cheyenne, Wyoming, from September 2, 1889 to September 30, 1889, and ratified by the voters November 5, 1889. The constitution became effective on July 10, 1890, on which date Wyoming was admitted as
            a state in the union. The constitution is printed herein as subsequently amended.)

            The constitution of Wyoming went into effect on July 10, 1890, upon approval of the Act of Admission of Wyoming into the union. State ex rel. Sullivan v. Schnitger, 16 Wyo. 479, 95 P. 698, <cite class="wy_code">1908 Wyo. LEXIS 35</cite> (Wyo.

        <p>
            A constitution should be construed so as to give effect to intent of the people in adopting it and according to the natural and most obvious import of the language. Rasmussen v. Baker, 7 Wyo. 117, 50 P. 819, <cite class="wy_code">1897 Wyo. LEXIS 17</cite>            (Wyo. 1897).
        </p>
        <p>
            The general principles governing construction of statutes apply to the construction of constitutions, the fundamental purpose being to ascertain the intent of the persons adopting them. Zancanelli v. Central Coal &amp; Coke Co., 25 Wyo. 511, 173 P. 981,
            <cite class="wy_code">1918 Wyo. LEXIS 17</cite> (Wyo. 1918).
        </p>
        <p>
            The constitution should be construed as a whole in order to ascertain the general purposes and meaning of each part. Ross v. Trustees of Univ., 31 Wyo. 464, 228 P. 642, <cite class="wy_code">1924 Wyo. LEXIS 40</cite> (Wyo. 1924).
        </p>
        <p>
            Constitutionality of a statute will not be passed on unless the decision is necessary to determination of the pending case. State v. Kelley, 17 Wyo. 335, 98 P. 886, <cite class="wy_code">1909 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 1909).

                    All power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority, and instituted for their peace, safety and happiness; for the advancement of these ends they have at all times an inalienable and indefeasible right to alter,

                    Art. 1, § 1, Wyo. Const., recognizes the ultimate right of the people to alter, reform, or abolish government, through peaceful means or otherwise, but when read in pari materia with the rest of the constitution, it does not contemplate the adoption of
                    laws under the existing government, whether by legislation or initiative, other than through constitutionally established means. Cathcart v. Meyer, 2004 WY 49, 88 P.3d 1050, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite>                    (Wyo. 2004).

                    Driver, who had his driver's license suspended for driving while under the influence while driving his personal noncommercial motor vehicle, was not deprived of his equal protection rights when, because he held a commercial driver's license, he was not
                    granted a probationary driver's license because of § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.31.html#t31c17s31-17-105" target="_blank">31-17-105</a></cite> (now repealed); the legislative concern with safety

                        Section 10, ch. 63, Laws 1913, concerning the transfer of prisoners, is not unconstitutional as violating constitutional guarantees of due process, equality of rights or trial by jury with opportunity to defend, nor as permitting exercise of arbitrary
                        power or a delegation of judicial functions to an executive board. Uram v. Roach, 47 Wyo. 335, 37 P.2d 793, <cite class="wy_code">1934 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1934).

                        Constitutional restriction of United States against unreasonable searches and seizures is about the same as constitutional restriction on that subject in Wyoming constitution, and federal courts have, speaking broadly, interpreted such restriction as
                        rigidly as Wyoming supreme court. State v. Hiteshew, 42 Wyo. 147, 292 P. 2, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 45</cite> (Wyo. 1930).

                    <p>
                        The provision of the Wyoming constitution covering search and seizure is different than that of the United States constitution and makes it mandatory that the search warrant be issued upon an affidavit. Smith v. State, 557 P.2d 130,

                    <p>
                        The language of this section differs somewhat from its federal counterpart and the court was unable to consider the impact of those differences where the defendant had not succeeded in invoking the independent protection of the Wyoming constitution. Wilson

                        This section has been recognized to be somewhat stronger than its federal counterpart in that under the Wyoming Constitution it is mandatory that the search warrant be issued upon an affidavit. Hall v. State, 911 P.2d 1364,

                    <p>
                        This section is narrower than its federal counterpart and requires a search to be reasonable under all circumstances. Vasquez v. State, 990 P.2d 476, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 169</cite> (Wyo. 1999).

                        Scope of the protection provided by the Wyoming Constitution is the “same as and parallel to” that provided by the federal constitution. Consonant with the Fourth Amendment, the opening of closed containers during an inventory search is permissible if
                        conducted in good faith, pursuant to a standardized police policy, and as long as the search is not a ruse for general rummaging for evidence of a crime; prior Wyoming precedent has permitted inventory searches and the opening
                        of closed containers during those searches. Johnson v. State, 2006 WY 79, 137 P.3d 903, <cite class="wy_code">2006 Wyo. LEXIS 85</cite> (Wyo. 2006).

                        conceal his identity; defendant eventually admitted the driver’s true identity, thereby revealing that she had previously lied about his identity; while she claimed that the protective order against the driver was no longer valid,
                        her previous dishonesty justified the trooper’s further efforts to verify the validity of that order, and her further detention; and the trooper then asked if there was anything illegal in her car, and defendant admitted that there
                        was marijuana in the car. Rodriguez v. State, 2018 WY 134, 430 P.3d 766, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 140</cite> (Wyo. 2018).

                        Public school students in Wyoming are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures by Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 4, but what is reasonable under all of the circumstances must be determined in light of factors such as the age of the students and the school
                        environment; because Wyoming school districts have a compelling interest in providing for the safety and welfare of their students, in order to maintain safety and welfare, schools are afforded the flexibility to impose rules on
                        students that might be inappropriate for adults. A school's role is custodial and tutelary, permitting a degree of supervision and control that could not be exercised over free adults; because of the degree of supervision and control
                        a school commonly exercises over its students, students generally have diminished privacy expectations born of the government's duty to maintain safety, order, and discipline in the schools. Hageman v. Goshen County Sch. Dist.

                        Because participation in extracurricular activities is optional, a policy requiring participating students to submit to random drug and alcohol testing preserves an option for a student who choose not to be tested. Such a student can refuse testing while
                        paying a price (nonparticipation) that is serious but less severe than expulsion from the school. A student who genuinely believes that his privacy rights are unduly infringed by the school district's policy may choose not to submit
                        to drug and alcohol testing. He will have to forego optional extracurricular activities, but he is not deprived of the fundamental right to an education. Hageman v. Goshen County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2011 WY 91, 256 P.3d 487,

                        Where a school district, in an effort to address a perceived drug and alcohol problem among its students, adopted a policy requiring all students who participated in extracurricular activities to consent to random drug and alcohol testing and where parents
                        filed suit, challenging the policy as unconstitutional, summary judgment was properly granted in favor of the school district because, while Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 4, protected public school students from unreasonable searches and
                        seizures, the testing at issue was reasonable; students were already subject to more stringent rules and regulations than adults and had limited expectations of privacy in the school setting, and the school district had a compelling
                        interest in providing for the safety and welfare of its students and thus had a legitimate interest in deterring drug and alcohol use among students. Further, the policy requiring random, suspicionless drug and alcohol testing
                        for all students who participated in extracurricular activities was rationally related to furthering its interest in deterring drug and alcohol use among students. Hageman v. Goshen County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2011 WY 91, 256 P.3d

                        Detention was reasonable under Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 4 because the totality of the circumstances showed, inter alia, that: the license plate on the vehicle was not on file; the registration had been altered; the license plate number did not match the

                        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence of marijuana that was found in defendant's vehicle because defendant's one-time lane deviation, which was extensive, both in time and distance, constituted a statutory violation, and
                        thus warranted a traffic stop; the deviation was eight inches over the fog line for approximately 550 feet. Dods v. State, 2010 WY 133, 240 P.3d 1208, <cite class="wy_code">2010 Wyo. LEXIS 142</cite> (Wyo.

                        (2) when the deputy entered the pullout area, he observed a “flurry of movement” in the front seat area of the vehicle; (3) when defendant partially lowered the passenger window, the deputy immediately noticed an “old burnt smell”
                        or “chemical smell” that he associated with drug use, but could not quite identify; (4) defendant's car seat was reclined back, making it difficult for the deputy to see defendant or his hands; and (5) defendant was visibly nervous.

                        District court erred in refusing to suppress drug-related evidence which was seized during a vehicle search incident to appellant's arrest for two traffic violations--driving under suspension and failing to maintain liability insurance--because there
                        was no reasonable basis, articulable from the totality of the circumstances, to justify the search, which violated Wyo. Const. art. I, § 4; with respect to the search, there was no reasonable basis for the officer to believe appellant
                        was armed or that there were weapons in the vehicle, and the “pat down” search of appellant's person did not uncover any weapons. By the officer's own account, he and appellant engaged in a friendly conversation, appellant was
                        honest about his suspended license, he seemingly offered a reasonable explanation for his presence at the park where he was arrested, and he cooperated with the officer and did not resist arrest or become combative; as such, the
                        State did not meet its burden to prove that the search-incident-to arrest exception applied. Pierce v. State, 2007 WY 182, 171 P.3d 525, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 194</cite> (Wyo. 2007).

                        Inclusion of defendant's belongings in an inventory search of an impounded car was proper because neither reasonable suspicion nor probable cause were required, and defendant's contention that his baggage should have been released to him prior to the
                        inventory would defeat the purpose of the inventory search. Defendant did not request his belongings prior to the inventory search, and even if he had, the officer was not required to provide them until after the contents were

                        The district court erred in suppressing evidence obtained as a result of the “canine sniff” of the respondents' vehicle; the initial stop was lawful and was followed by a minimally intrusive detention of the vehicle and the respondents on a reasonably

                        closely, the trooper testified that he saw defendants following a truck at less than one vehicle length behind, and there was nothing in the record warranting a conclusion that the district court's credibility determination or
                        finding of probable cause was clearly erroneous or contrary to law. The totality of the circumstances was further sufficient to support the conclusion that the trooper had reasonable suspicion that defendants were transporting
                        controlled substances due to a drug dog sniff; thus, questioning them about matters outside the scope of the traffic violation was reasonable and provided probable cause for the search. Phelps v. State, 2012 WY 87, 278 P.3d 1148,

                        Requirements for seizure of evidence in plain view are: (1) the officers' presence must be proper; (2) the items observed must appear to the officer to be possible evidence; and (3) the “plain view” doctrine is applicable only to the inadvertent discovery

                        Defendant's rights were not violated when sheriff's investigators retrieved boots from property room at a county detention center without a search warrant, after he was jailed, in order to conduct experiments on them. His boots were legally seized when

                        And technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common-law pleadings have no proper place in the area of issuing warrants. A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers
                        from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting. This is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant's or an informer's belief that probable
                        cause exists without detailing any of the underlying circumstances upon which that belief is based. Croker v. State, 477 P.2d 122, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 206</cite> (Wyo. 1970); McCutcheon

                        District court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the results of his blood alcohol concentration test because the affidavit in support of the search warrant was deficient since it contained bare conclusions; the judge issuing the warrant
                        was not provided with facts supporting the officer's conclusion that defendant was driving when the warrant was issued, and some of the underlying factual information supporting that conclusion was essential to support issuance

                        Where the claim is that the police have improperly searched or seized something, the claimant must have had a legitimate expectation of privacy as to that thing. Factors to be considered in making this determination include: (1) the precautions taken
                        in order to maintain one's privacy; (2) the likely intent of the drafters of the United States and Wyoming constitutions; (3) the property rights the claimant possessed in the invaded area; and (4) the legitimacy of the individual's
                        possession of or presence in the property which was searched or seized. Parkhurst v. State, 628 P.2d 1369, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 347</cite> (Wyo.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 899, 102 S. Ct.

                        victims because: (1) defendant was the subject of an order of protection under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.35.html#t35c21s35-21-104ol1b" target="_blank">35-21-104(b)</a></cite>;

                        to the police; (4) while the victims waited for the police to arrive at the crisis center, defendant and his companion drove by a second time; and (5) a police officer searched defendant's person incident to arresting him for violation
                        of the order of protection; that the cursory search of the car's interior uncovered evidence of the possession with intent to deliver proscribed narcotics, rather than evidence of the violation of the protection order, did not

                        not be arrested that day, and was free to leave at any time. In addition, the confession was voluntary as the trial court held a full evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress the statements and had the opportunity
                        to hear the witness' testimony and weigh their credibility. Hannon v. State, 2004 WY 8, 84 P.3d 320, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 12</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

                        identify his supplier or customers, despite the fact the occupants were watched to ensure that no evidence was compromised, they were allowed to do what they pleased, defendant apparently slept for a great deal of the time the

                        In a case where defendant gave a confession to taking indecent liberties with a minor, a motion to suppress evidence was properly denied. Although witnesses testified that defendant was intoxicated both before and after the interview, this was not enough

                        guilt was overwhelming, the district court gave a jury instruction immediately prior to the prosecutor's opening statement, and the district court also specifically instructed the jury to disregard the prosecutor's remarks immediately

                        In an arson case, defendant was not denied his right to a fair trial based on prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor made a valid inquiry into defendant's ability to recall with accuracy the events that occurred before, during and after the time

                        for which an objection was sustained. In addition, the existence of a check was as well known to defendant as it was to the prosecution, so the evidence was not withheld. Strickland v. State, 2004 WY 91, 94 P.3d 1034,

                        judges had discretion to grant or deny credit for time served in presentence custody if the custody was not due to defendant's indigency and the amount of time plus the sentence did not exceed the maximum allowable sentence. Daniels

                            to modify the decree should have been granted because the supplemental affidavit contained claims for relief that were not in the original complaint. Bradley v. Bradley, 2005 WY 107, 118 P.3d 984,

                            condition and wanted the divorce finalized before she died, and where the district court entered a divorce decree awarding a divorce to the wife and retaining jurisdiction to equitably divide the marital estate after efforts

                            under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 6, because the motion for an emergency hearing to award a divorce in a proceeding in which both parties had agreed that a divorce was appropriate was not a motion that
                            would determine the final rights of either party. The final rights of the parties were left to be determined at a later date, and the husband would be afforded a full hearing prior to a determination of his final rights. Kelly

                            delegations of public power to private entities or to public agencies, and any constitutional limitation was therefore indirect; here, applicants had sufficient guarantees of due process, and the delegation of accreditation

                            In Wyoming dependency/neglect proceedings, due process requires that if a change in a permanency plan includes adoption or permanent placement other than reunification, parents must have the right to request, and on request must be provided with, an evidentiary
                            hearing, and a parent must request the hearing if he or she desires one, because there may be instances in which parents do not dispute a recommendation or are content with a non-evidentiary hearing, so the failure to request

                            The fact that railroads are required to fence their rights-of-way while motor transports are not required to fence a highway right-of-way is not discriminatory so as to make the requirement unconstitutional. Chicago &amp; N. W. R.R. v. Bishop, 390 P.2d

                            A city ordinance providing a height limitation in a noninstrument approach zone to an airport was an exercise of the police power, and certain home owners who had a tree in violation of this limitation, who were notified they would have to trim it, and
                            who challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, failed to demonstrate such a significant impact on their plot as a whole as to counterbalance the significant public interest in protecting the airport flight path. Cheyenne

                            the amount of the benefit for a given assistance unit, was not properly established, the “facts” which she would have resolved in a hearing are legislative facts. Walker v. Karpan, 726 P.2d 82,

                            Due process requires expenditure of public monies for tests performed by a defense expert where those tests could exclude a defendant as the guilty party. The court, however, does not commit error when it holds that the state does not have to pay for
                            a medical examination where, in a parental-termination hearing, a father is charged with having “sexual intercourse” with his daughter because, even if the examination reveals no rupture or trauma to the hymeneal area — a factor
                            which serves to deny sexual intercourse in the medical sense — from the legal point of view, this physical evidence does not mean that the father has not engaged in sexual intercourse, as sexual intercourse, as defined in law,
                            is accomplished if there is the slightest penetration of the sexual organ of the female by the sexual organ of the male. In re Matter of GP, 679 P.2d 976, <cite class="wy_code">1984 Wyo. LEXIS 269</cite>                            (Wyo. 1984).

                            The purpose behind uniform traffic citations is to provide for the speedy and effective disposition of traffic offenses. Within such an informal procedure it is not necessary that the charge be set forth with the same technical precision and formality

                            In a murder case, defendant was not denied the right to a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutors, in making certain statements regarding the defendant's capacity for lying, were not attempting to induce the jurors to base their
                            factual determinations on the prosecutors' personal beliefs or opinions, but were merely pointing out that the evidence and the testimony of the prosecution's witnesses contradicted that of defendant. Duke v. State, 2004 WY

                            Prosecution has burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that a defendant's statement to law enforcement officers was voluntarily made. Edwards v. State, 973 P.2d 41, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 12</cite>                            (Wyo. 1999).

                        <p>
                            Defendant's statement to law enforcement officers was voluntarily given; there was no evidence that officers or prosecutor intimidated defendant or improperly induced him to sign immunity agreement in exchange for his statement, and prosecutor was justified
                            in later nullifying agreement on grounds that defendant's statement proved to be substantially incorrect. Edwards v. State, 973 P.2d 41, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 12</cite> (Wyo. 1999).

                            There was no error in the trial court's determination that the defendant's statements/confessions were voluntary where (1) the only allegation of coercion arose from the defendant's subjective perception that if he cooperated/confessed, then his children
                            would be returned to him, but the district court resolved that evidentiary dispute in favor of the state, (2) there was no indication that the defendant's mental state was impaired, other than the natural anxiety a defendant
                            might feel where drugs are found in his home and he has been involved in the distribution of those drugs, and (3) the defendant was read his Miranda rights, and he was given the opportunity to speak with a lawyer if he chose.

                            Because defendant, who was convicted of indecent liberties with a child, was not in custody when questioned at his residence by the police, no Miranda warnings were required; similarly, staements made by defendant during a custodial interview at the sherfiff's
                            office were made voluntarily, and there was no evidence in the record to support a showing of coercive government action. Gunn v. State, 2003 WY 24, 64 P.3d 716, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite>                            (Wyo. 2003).

                            Statements that defendant made during her interrogation were not voluntary and, therefore, should have been suppressed, where the police had already identified her as being the principal suspect and, even though she was upset and crying because she was

                            Defendant's statements to police were knowing and voluntary and trial court correctly denied his motions to suppress; although police interview occurred eleven hours after defendant was first advised of his Miranda rights and after surgery to defendant's

                            defendant's unwarned statements did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury, so the admission of the evidence was harmless error. Lewis v. State, 2002 WY 92, 48 P.3d 1063,

                            the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the jury to have the entire statement to consider. The State pointed out that although defendant could have requested a limiting instruction directing the jury to restrict

                            and make a statement, were voluntary as was his waiver of Miranda rights that occurred about five minutes after police began his interview, and (2) inquiry ceased when defendant asked about obtaining a lawyer and specified

                            A defendant is denied due process where the prosecutor delays filing charges to gain a tactical advantage, and where substantial prejudice results from the delay. An “implication” that an intentional delay existed is not enough; some evidence must be
                            in the record to support the charge. Also, an argument by the defendant that she “suffered greatly” from a delay because of the death of a witness is not enough; the defendant must demonstrate why her defense was impaired.

                            In a murder case, there was no evidence in the transcript or in the record that the court's comments admonishing counsel for their conduct caused prejudice and deprived the defendant of a fair trial. Moreover, the court's comments did not interfere with
                            the attorney-client relationship, so as to deprive the defendant of the right to a fair trial, where the court did not express an opinion on the appropriateness of the defense strategy until after the defendant indicated that
                            the defendant would not pursue that strategy. In addition, with respect to the court's merely reiterating an argument made to it by the prosecution, the defendant's contention that the court committed misconduct by supplying
                            the state with the basis for the admission of evidence was contrary to the record and without merit. Also, the court did not commit misconduct by specifically directing a particular statement towards the prosecutor, where the
                            statement was not a comment on the evidence, but rather, was an expression of frustration on the part of the court over what it perceived as unnecessary and dilatory tactics by the prosecution. Belden v. State, 2003 WY 89,

                        It was erroneous for a trial court to have closed the proceedings to the public in a termination of parental rights case to preserve the confidentiality of Wyoming Department of Family Services records concerning reports and investigations in the neglect

                        The ultimate test of whether a state agency or employee may be made liable to suit without consent of the state must be found in the answer to the question whether the agency or employee was engaged in a governmental function. Where the activity has been
                        undertaken at the direction of the legislature, or involves legislative or judicial discretion, it has been held to be governmental, but where the activity has historically been carried on by a private corporation, or if it generates
                        fees, it is proprietary. Biscar v. University of Wyoming Bd. of Trustees, 605 P.2d 374, <cite class="wy_code">1980 Wyo. LEXIS 229</cite> (Wyo. 1980).

                        Even though the jury incorrectly concluded that the necessary elements were present to elevate the defendant's crime from burglary to aggravated burglary, an examination of the record disclosed there was sufficient evidence presented to justify the jury's
                        finding that each of the elements of burglary was met. Therefore, the defendant's conviction for the crime of aggravated burglary was set aside, but his conviction was sustained as to the lesser included offense of burglary. Such
                        an action was not a violation of the defendant's due process right under U.S. Const., amend. XIV, § 1 and Wyo. Const., art. 1, § 6, or of his right to a trial by jury under Wyo. Const., art. 1, § 9. Simonds v. State, 762 P.2d 1189,

                        Defendant was not denied his right to effectively cross-examine the child victim and any error was harmless; the victim provided verbal responses to most questions and her motive in not answering some questions might have been due to a lack of memory
                        or a misunderstanding as opposed to a refusal to answer. Defense counsel’s cessation of questioning appeared to have been strategic and even assuming defendant would have been able to discredit the victim, the verdict would not
                        have been different because her testimony was not the only evidence of guilt. Tamblyn v. State, 2020 WY 76, 465 P.3d 440, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 86</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

                        Because the victim and forensic examiner were under subpoena requiring them to testify at trial, but defendant did not call them to testify, he was not denied an opportunity to confront those witnesses, and the amendment to the felony information, without

                        Trial counsel was not ineffective because excessive cross-examination carried risk, it could have allowed the witness to walk back statements favorable to the defense, elicited unfavorable testimony, or inadvertently enhanced the witness’s or the victim’s
                        credibility; the fact that trial counsel could have pursued a different strategy by continuing to press a witness on her pretrial statements did not prove counsel’s assistance ineffective. Shields v. State, 2020 WY 101, 468 P.3d

                        Trial counsel demonstrated the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary to represent defendant because there was no requirement that defense attorneys in cases involving charges of sexual abuse of a minor to have specialized
                        training and experience; defendant indicated her desire to continue with lead counsel. Shields v. State, 2020 WY 101, 468 P.3d 1097, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 116</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

                        Trial counsel did not perform deficiently with respect to their pretrial investigation, and no prejudice showing had been made, because defendant did not identify how trial counsels’ further review of and familiarity with the materials they received from
                        the State before trial would have benefited the defense or otherwise affected the trial outcome. Shields v. State, 2020 WY 101, 468 P.3d 1097, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 116</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

                    <p>
                        Defendant failed to show that had trial counsel raised a pre-trial taint argument, it would have prevented the minor victim from testifying or that by presenting the taint evidence only at trial her chances of acquittal were lessened because there was
                        no evidence that a reasonably competent attorney would have requested a separate taint hearing; to the extent the defense advanced a peripheral taint argument at trial, trial counsel implemented sufficient safeguards through cross-examination.

                        object to the instructions as defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to object because the evidence against him was overwhelming as defendant’s statements over several weeks confirmed he had the specific intent to inflict
                        sexual intrusion upon the victim and his actions were strongly corroborative of the firmness of his intention to complete the crime of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. Weston v. State, 2019 WY 113, 451 P.3d 758,

                        trial and because of persistent chest pain, there was a risk of a major heart attack or cardiac complications occurring in the future; (2) the defendant was not present to assist and consult with his attorney when instructions

                        The assistance of counsel is such a basic right that the lack of such assistance can never be treated as harmless error. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to indulge in nice calculations as to

                        While a trial court has the power in its discretion to appoint substitute counsel, its refusal to do so is not error unless an abuse of discretion is shown. A factual showing of good cause for the appointment of substitute counsel is essential to the
                        demonstration of an abuse of discretion, and good cause is to be found in incompetence, commitment to a position or an interest which would conflict with the furnishing of an effective defense to the accused, or other good reason

                        Under Wyoming's judicial revocation procedure where the state is represented by a prosecutor and the rules of evidence apply to a portion of the proceedings, the Sixth Amendment requires appointment of counsel for indigent probationers when the indigent

                        Defendant's right to counsel under Wyo. Const. art. 1, § 10 was not violated when a public defender other than the one appointed to represent defendant appeared on a hearing on defendant's motion to proceed pro se; defendant's claim of ineffective assistance
                        of counsel was without merit because defendant made no showing an actual conflict of interest as contended, nor did defendant show prejudice. May v. State, 2003 WY 14, 62 P.3d 574, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite>                        (Wyo. 2003).

                        In a murder and robbery case, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Given defendant's plea of not guilty by reason of mental illness, defense counsel had no choice but to present the alternative theories consistent with his client's
                        alternate pleas; counsel did not fail to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing; and counsel's misstatement during closing argument did not fall below standards of reasonable competency. Sincock v. State,

                        In a murder case, defendant failed to sustain his burden of proving that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because counsel (1) failed to object to the joinder of the charges for trial; (2) failed to object
                        to hearsay testimony and unduly prejudicial evidence; (3) failed to adequately investigate; (4) failed to object to leading questions; (5) failed to object to the district court's erroneous application of W.R.E. 613; (6) failed
                        to make a record objection to the security measures employed at trial; (7) failed to object to the use of, and the jury's reliance upon, a demonstrative exhibit that was never introduced into evidence; (8) failed to object to the
                        jury being advised it was a non-capital case; and (9) failed to offer any defense instructions, particularly theory-of-defense instructions. On the contrary, defense counsel vigorously represented his client and challenged the
                        prosecution's evidence, and defendant did not demonstrate that counsel's performance was outside the range of professionally competent assistance, nor did he show that the outcome of his trial would have been different absent attorney

                        that defendant was subjected to express questioning, or its functional equivalent, prior to being advised of his Miranda rights. After he was arrested, an officer located defendant in a patrol vehicle and read him his Miranda rights,

                        In a hearing on remand, although the trial court considered and rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, despite the availability of the evidence from the remand hearing, despite bearing the burden of proof, and in the face of the
                        standard of review for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the trial court's detailed decision letter, defendant presented to the supreme court only two and one-half pages of very generalized argument supporting his
                        allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel; in effect, defendant's brief was nothing more than a recitation of the allegations themselves, with no analysis of either the allegedly deficient conduct, or any prejudice that
                        might have resulted therefrom, and thus his ineffective assistance of counsel claim was denied. Rion v. State, 2007 WY 197, 172 P.3d 734, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 210</cite> (Wyo. 2007).

                        35 serious felony charges were dropped. Palmer v. State, 2008 WY 7, 174 P.3d 1298, <cite class="wy_code">2008 Wyo. LEXIS 8</cite> (Wyo. 2008).

                        the State's witnesses, which he formulated with the expert's assistance. Griggs v. State, 2016 WY 16, 367 P.3d 1108, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite> (Wyo. 2016).

                        trial witnesses, and implying that defendant's testimony was not credible simply because he had been charged with crimes. Defendant bore the burden of establishing prosecutorial misconduct and did not object to the alleged incidents
                        of misconduct at trial, and the prosecutor's remarks were legitimate argument as to what particular inferences the jury should and should not make based on the evidence produced at trial, and what evidence and other factors the

                        there was other evidence admitted to show the condition of an apartment before the fire. There was also no prosecutorial misconduct relating to the questioning of the inspector about the reasons for setting a fire since defense

                        The purpose behind uniform traffic citations is to provide for the speedy and effective disposition of traffic offenses. Within such an informal procedure it is not necessary that the charge be set forth with the same technical precision and formality
                        as required in an information or verified complaint. All that is required is that the accused be informed of the nature of the offense with which he is charged. Such a requirement can be fulfilled by stating the commonly used name
                        of the offense and the statute or ordinance violated. This is sufficient even if it means the accused may be required to inquire of the arresting officer or someone else exactly what the offense includes. Swisse v. Sheridan, 561

                        An indictment to be legally sufficient must fairly indicate the crime charged, must state the essential elements of the alleged crime, must be sufficiently definite so that the defendant can prepare his defense and must grant protection from further prosecution

                        Where a defendant is not misled to his prejudice, an indictment is not invalid because it does not conform exactly to the language of the statute. However, any variations from the statutory language must be in words carrying the same import as the statute.

                        It was clear that defendant had adequate notice of the charge for which he was convicted, one count of larceny by bailee in violation of Wyo. Stat.

The court did not see the amount of evidence presented as creating a problem with defendant's right to notice of the charges against him; it simply
                        amounted to a failure of proof on the State's part; moreover, there was no prejudice to defendant as the trial court specifically rejected the State's contentions as to the other items. Barker v. State, 2006 WY 104, 141 P.3d 106,

                        In defendant's sexual assault case, a court violated defendant's confrontation rights by prohibiting defendant from cross-examining the victim where the victim was the only witness to the alleged crime, there was no physical evidence tying defendant to
                        the alleged assault nor were there any eyewitnesses, the victim did not report the allegations until three months after the fact when he was brought in for questioning about his own sexual improprieties with another boy. Had defense
                        counsel been allowed to explore the issue with the victim during cross-examination, the jury reasonably might have inferred that the victim was fearful about what would happen to him as a result of his own acts and concocted the

                        In an indecent liberties case, defendant's constitutional right to present a defense was not denied by the court's refusal to admit the testimony of a witness regarding an assessment of the relationship between the victim's father and the victim so that
                        the factfinder might infer that the victim had a motive to lie. The purported testimony was not relevant, or was at most conditionally relevant, and the necessary preconditions were not met. Person v. State, 2004 WY 149, 100 P.3d

                        be viewed as evidence of diminished capacity, it was not appropriate to expand defense of mental incapacity beyond the scope of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.07.html#t07c11a03s7-11-302" target="_blank">7-11-302</a></cite>,

                        In the constitutional context, the following standards must be met in order for prior testimony to be admissible: (1) the prosecution must demonstrate that good faith efforts to obtain the presence of the missing witness for trial have been unavailing;
                        and (2) the witness must have been subject to adequate cross-examination at the previous hearing or trial. Grable v. State, 649 P.2d 663, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 371</cite> (Wyo. 1982), overruled

                        Former testimony is admissible under the confrontation clauses of both the constitutions of the United States and Wyoming if the witness who gave the former testimony is unavailable to testify at trial and if the prior testimony bore an “indicia of reliability”
                        sufficient to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the prior statement. Prior testimony bears an adequate indicia of reliability when the prior testimony was given under oath, when it was given
                        while the defendant was represented by counsel, when the defendant's counsel could and did cross-examine the witness, and when cross-examination which would be conducted at trial would not touch upon any new and significantly material
                        line of inquiry. Impeachment of the witness, who identified the defendant at the preliminary hearing, is not a new line of inquiry. Rodriguez v. State, 711 P.2d 410, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 624</cite>                        (Wyo. 1985).

                        District court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial as fairness and impartiality were not lost when a potential juror expressed an opinion that defendant should be locked up because the district court also took appropriate
                        curative measures by dismissing the potential juror for cause, instructing the members of the jury pool to disregard the statement, and, at the behest of defense counsel, advising the jury pool on the presumption of innocence.

                        In a child sexual abuse case, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion for a mistrial as defendant was not deprived of a fair and impartial jury because all the venire who became emotional while explaining the source
                        of their concerns for serving on the jury were excused for cause; and the record did not indicate that the other potential jurors became biased because they observed those excused as defendant was acquitted of three of the four

                        Where two persons charged with a crime arising out of the same transaction are granted separate trials, a juror hearing the trial of the first defendant is not qualified as a juror for the subsequent trial of the second defendant, the reason being that
                        the juror has formed or expressed an opinion upon the merits of the case. The refusal to excuse such an unqualified juror for cause is prejudicial where the defendant challenges the juror for cause, the court denies the challenge,

                        District court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss his trial for sexual assault based on an alleged violation of defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial where a 235 day delay occurred between defendant's waiver of the preliminary
                        hearing and defendant's arraignment. The time period was not presumptively prejudicial and only 120 days was shown to have been attributable to the State, the other days being attributable to defendant's dissatisfaction with the
                        assignment of judges and the resulting docketing issues, and defendant was not incarcerated and had made little or no effort to locate witnesses. Walters v. State, 2004 WY 37, 87 P.3d 793, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 43</cite>                        (Wyo. 2004).

                        Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and Wyo. Const. Art. 1, § 10 because, although a delay of nearly a year warranted careful analysis, the delay was not so excessive that it resulted in a presumption
                        of prejudice. Defendant had suffered prejudice because of the length of his pretrial incarceration, but the critical factor was the parties' contributions to the delay, and defendant had demanded and received a special prosecutor
                        and new defense counsel and his part in the delay weighed against finding that his constitutional right was violated. Sisneros v.

                        while the prosecutor did not have a good reason for the delay — his indecision as to the constitutionality of the original charge, aggravated vehicular homicide —, at least his motives were legitimate; (3) the defendant preserved
                        his speedy trial right by raising timely objections; but (4) the defendant could not prove prejudice, in that the testimony of his chief witness, who disappeared before trial, was stipulated to by the prosecution, and in that he
                        was free on bond during the entire proceeding. Caton v. State, 709 P.2d 1260, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 621</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

                        witnesses and one continuance was sought in order to allow an expert witness to examine potentially exculpatory evidence regarding the subject vehicle; (2) there was no evidence indicating that the vehicle's condition was actually
                        altered or somehow prevented the defendant or his expert from examining or testing the vehicle in anticipation of trial; and (3) defendant did not show any actual prejudice, citing only pretrial anxiety and not even his pretrial

                        a very limited extent as a result of the delay, but his much weightier contribution to the delay - for example, he requested a mental evaluation, but then told the examiner not to complete and finalize the report - counseled against

                        until he thought the speedy trial clock had run, the delay was caused by the overcrowded docket and some inattention to speedy trial concerns, and defendant received full credit for the time spent in jail. Seteren v. State, 2007

                        Where defendant was first indicted for murder in 1980 but charges were dismissed and then refiled in 2004, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because although delay occurred in bringing defendant to trial and defendant
                        asserted her right to a speedy trial, length of the delay was not unreasonable in light of the facts in this case and where defendant had not demonstrated actual prejudice arising from delay in criminal proceedings. Humphrey v.

                        there was no allegation that the State deliberately attempted to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense, defendant did not vigorously assert his right to a speedy trial, and there was no showing that the victims' memories

                        In a murder case, a court properly denied defendant's motion for change of venue where the news articles were generally factual in nature, reporting information obtained from court documents and from a potential witness, and they were not sensational,
                        inflammatory, or prejudicial. Defense counsel and the trial court appropriately and properly examined the jury venire, and there was no indication that the pretrial publicity made jury selection difficult or created such prejudice
                        that a change of venue was necessary. Duke v. State, 2004 WY 120, 99 P.3d 928, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 157</cite> (Wyo. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1062, 125 S. Ct. 2513, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1113,

                        In defendant's felony murder case, the trial court did not err by failing to grant a change of venue because sixty-five jurors were summoned for the trial, of those, 12 had heard about the case, and each of those jurors was closely examined. One juror
                        expressed a view that he could not put aside his opinion and he was excused for cause, and at the close of voir dire, defendant passed the jury for cause and had no objections to the jury selection. Lemus v. State, 2007 WY 111,

                        A murder defendant's statement that he went outside his house to fight the victim and then stabbed the victim by reflex was admissible, where it was not the product of an interrogation and the police were merely informing the defendant of the charges

                        To determine whether an accused was in custody during an interrogation, two distinct inquiries are required, one into the circumstances surrounding the interrogation and one into whether a reasonable person would have felt at liberty to terminate the
                        interrogation and leave. Kolb v. State, 930 P.2d 1238, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 185</cite> (Wyo. 1996).

                        Because defendant, who was convicted of indecent liberties with a child, was not in custody when questioned at his residence by the police, no Miranda warnings were required, and the statements made by defendant during a custodial interview at the sheriff's
                        office were made voluntarily, where the defendant pointed to no evidence in the record to support a showing of coercive government action. Gunn v. State, 2003 WY 24, 64 P.3d 716, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite>                        (Wyo. 2003).

                        Defendant's statements to police did not violate his self-incrimination rights where the detective characterized the interrogation as her posing questions to defendant and he ‘answered if he wanted to.’ He took advantage of that option by refusing to
                        identify his supplier or customers, despite the fact the occupants were watched to ensure that no evidence was compromised, they were allowed to do what they pleased, defendant apparently slept for a great deal of the time the
                        officers searched the premises, and, when he needed to relieve himself, the officers respected his choice to go outside rather than be accompanied to the restroom by an officer. Gompf v. State, 2005 WY 112, 120 P.3d 980,

                        Counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress defendant's statements to officers because defendant did not demonstrate that a suppression motion based on the alleged Miranda violation would have been granted as it did not appear
                        that defendant was subjected to express questioning, or its functional equivalent, prior to being advised of his Miranda rights. After he was arrested, an officer located defendant in a patrol vehicle, read him his Miranda rights,
                        and defendant indicated that he understood his rights and that he wanted to waive those rights and make a statement. Grissom v. State, 2005 WY 132, 121 P.3d 127, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo. LEXIS 158</cite>                        (Wyo. 2005).

                        In defendant's sexual assault case, a court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress his confession where the confession was non-custodial because he went to the station of his own will, he was told he did not have to answer questions, would
                        not be arrested that day, and was free to leave at any time. In addition, the confession was voluntary as the trial court held a full evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress the statements and had the opportunity
                        to hear the witness' testimony and weigh their credibility. Hannon v. State, 2004 WY 8, 84 P.3d 320, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 12</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

                        The court properly limited the admissibility of statements made by the defendant to investigating officers to those that were furnished prior to the advice that the victim had died. These statements were the product of uncoerced choice and demonstrated
                        sufficient comprehension to assure that the waiver of the defendant's right to silence was made with full awareness of both the nature of his right and the consequences of his decision. Cutbirth v. State, 751 P.2d 1257,

                        statements during the interview about how the victim received his injuries; however, he emphatically denied killing the victim throughout the interview, and there was abundant evidence in the record that the defendant did in fact

                        to tell the officers were not unambiguous invocations of his right to remain silent. Pena v. State, 2004 WY 115, 98 P.3d 857, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

                        A motion to suppress a confession was properly denied in a case involving sexual assault because it was voluntarily given; defendant was not promised probation, and defendant's nervousness and learning disability were not relevant since very simple “yes”
                        or “no” questions were asked, and the process was thoroughly explained. Wilkins v. State, 2005 WY 2, 104 P.3d 85, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 2005).

                        Defendant's statements to police did not violate his self-incrimination rights where the detective characterized the interrogation as her posing questions to defendant and he ‘answered if he wanted to.’ He took advantage of that option by refusing to
                        identify his supplier or customers, despite the fact the occupants were watched to ensure that no evidence was compromised, they were allowed to do what they pleased, defendant apparently slept for a great deal of the time the
                        officers searched the premises, and, when he needed to relieve himself, the officers respected his choice to go outside rather than be accompanied to the restroom by an officer. Gompf v. State, 2005 WY 112, 120 P.3d 980,

                        In a case where defendant gave a confession to taking indecent liberties with a minor, a motion to suppress evidence was properly denied. Although witnesses testified that defendant was intoxicated both before and after the interview, this was not enough
                        to justify suppression where defendant gave appropriate answers and appeared to have understood the questions posed during the interview, and defendant initiated contact with police after requesting an attorney. The fact that defendant
                        might have been led to believe that his leaving after the questioning was a possibility was not sufficient evidence of coercion. Gordon v. State, 2004 WY 105, 97 P.3d 64, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 133</cite>                        (Wyo. 2004).

                        Self-incriminating statements are not per se admissible over objection, when the evidence discloses that the defendant was in custody for the crime charged at the time of making such statements, unless shown to have been voluntarily made. There is no
                        presumption that such statements are voluntarily made, but, on the contrary, the presumption is the other way, and upon the trial of an accused the burden is upon the state, seeking to prove such statements, to show their voluntary
                        character. Dryden v. State, 535 P.2d 483, <cite class="wy_code">1975 Wyo. LEXIS 141</cite> (Wyo. 1975).

                        When a district court does not have the evidence to make a determination that coercion did or did not cause the defendant to make a statement, it has no choice but to decide that the state has not rebutted the presumption that the statement was involuntary.

                        The question is not whether the examining officers have been “unfair” to the accused; it is whether the state has proved that the statements were freely made by an informed and knowledgeable accused after full and proper warning as to his constitutional

                        To support the state's position that a defendant was not threatened or promised anything in such a way as to coerce a confession, the state must supply the court with details of all relevant circumstances as well as the interrogating officer's reasons
                        for believing the defendant appeared to freely decide for himself to forego the assistance of counsel and provide an incriminating statement. State v. Evans, 944 P.2d 1120, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 115</cite>                        (Wyo. 1997).

                        The arresting officer's references to the defendant's initial silence when the officer encountered him were not comments upon the defendant's exercise of the right to silence; the fact that the appellant initially ignored the officer and failed to respond
                        to him was presented in direct testimony simply as part of the circumstances under which the officer first encountered the defendant and continued his contact with him, the questions and answers had nothing to do with the crime
                        itself, and the prosecutor did not mention in opening or argue in closing that the appellant's silence somehow proved guilt. Lancaster v.

                        The defendant, prior to agreeing to participate in interrogation sessions, had signed a statement acknowledging his right to stop answering questions at any time and had refused to respond to questions during two sessions of interrogation at the police

                        directed the jury's attention to his silence when asked certain questions, thereby inviting the inference that a truthful answer would have established guilt. These statements constituted impermissible comment on the defendant's

                        Prosecution of defendant for felony interference with a peace officer, after defendant had pleaded guilty to misdemeanor interference with a peace officer, did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause because defendant committed two separate acts of interference

                        It was not plain error to convict defendant of both strangulation of a household member and the lesser-included offense of domestic battery because the convictions did not violate a clear and unequivocal rule of law, as the convictions did not violate

                        as the jury was not required to find every element of sexual abuse to convict defendant of kidnapping, and the jury had to find only that defendant removed the child victim with the intent to commit sexual abuse. Double jeopardy

                        requesting a mistrial because, although the prosecutor acknowledged that he misunderstood the law and conceded his questioning encroached on defendant's right to silence, the prosecutor's comments did not support a conclusion that
                        he acted intentionally in the hopes of the trial ending prematurely as he explained that he did not act maliciously in trying to impeach defendant with statements he had previously made; and he argued that the error did not rise

                        The trial court did not err in allowing prior crimes to be used a second time to enhance defendant's current sentence; habitual criminality is a status rather than a substantive offense, and a finding of such only enhances punishment for the most recent

                        was relevant, rather than balancing the employee's properly asserted privilege against the conflicting interests of the Workers' Compensation Division. Debyah v. State ex rel. Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2015 WY 94, 353 P.3d 711,

                        Where the jury found defendant not guilty of attempted first degree murder and attempted second degree murder, the district court granted the State's motion to dismiss the attempted first degree murder charge without prejudice. Because the State could
                        not re-charge defendant under the Double Jeopardy Clause, an order clarifying that the dismissal was with prejudice was appropriate. Landeroz v. State, 2011 WY 168, 267 P.3d 1075, <cite class="wy_code">2011 Wyo. LEXIS 176</cite>                        (Wyo. 2011).

                        Habitual criminal statute does not punish a defendant for his previous offenses but for his persistence in crime, and to be a habitual criminal involves a status rather than the commission of a separate offense; hence, the use of defendant's prior convictions
                        in 1983, 1987, and 1997 to enhance each of his aggravated assault convictions did not violate his right against double jeopardy. Urbigkit v. State, 2003 WY 57, 67 P.3d 1207, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 70</cite>                        (Wyo. 2003).

                        In capital offenses right to bail in favor of an accused arises when proof is not evident nor the presumption great. State v. Crocker, 5 Wyo. 385, 40 P. 681, <cite class="wy_code">1895 Wyo. LEXIS 32</cite> (Wyo. 1895).

                        Under this section, first degree murder being a capital offense, a person charged with that crime is not entitled to bail if the evidence presented on the hearing is such that if presented on the trial it would be sufficient to sustain a verdict of murder
                        in the first degree. Meldrum v. Campbell, 20 Wyo. 87, 121 P. 26, <cite class="wy_code">1912 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1912).

                        The language of this section provides without equivocation that all persons shall be bailable, and it must control the right to bail over Rule 46.1, W.R. Cr. P; the Wyoming constitution does not permit denial of bail on the ground that the accused is

                        to her genetically created ambiguous gender, because the inmate was provided with the basic necessities such as food, warmth, and exercise, and the officials were not in disregard of the inmate's and other prisoners' safety, although
                        no precise safety risk was identified. DiMarco v. Wyo. Dep't of Corr., 300 F. Supp. 2d 1183, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2371 (D. Wyo. 2004).

                        Where applicant for a gun permit contended he had a fundamental right to own a firearm, guaranteed by the Wyoming Constitution, and that he was, therefore, entitled to a hearing, the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that there was no constitutional right

                        In view of the fact that the rule against perpetuities is embodied in a statute and in the constitution in Wyoming, a court is without authority to carve out an exception to the constitutional and statutory provision or to circumvent the constitution

                        Assignment in trust of all mineral royalties from certain lands to a trustee for the account of beneficiaries was a conveyance in fee simple to the trustee with an immediate vesting of the equitable interest in the beneficiaries, and therefore, the rule

                        The provisions in a stream adjudication decree, authorizing the state engineer to monitor Indian reserved water rights, were proper, as they contemplated neither the application of state law nor the authority to deprive the Tribes of water without the
                        assistance of the courts in a suit for the administration of the decree. The role of the state engineer was not to apply state law, but to enforce the reserved rights against state appropriators, as decreed under principles of

                        Trial court properly emphasized that in the absence of eminent domain proceedings the action was an inverse condemnation case because eminent domain proceedings were not used by a county for the expansion of a road; according to the county, it did not

                        “Property” as contained in this section, for which an owner must receive “just compensation” when taken or damaged by a condemnor, is treated as a word of most general import and is liberally construed. It is addressed to every sort of interest the citizen
                        may possess, and there is nothing to indicate that the legislature, in providing the right of setoff for benefits, used the word “property” in any different sense. State Highway Comm'n v. Rollins, 471 P.2d 324,

                        The mere fact of airplane overflight, without evidence of impact on the surface (i.e., substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the surface), did not create a constitutional claim against either the city or its airport board, which adopted
                        an ordinance providing a height limitation in a noninstrument approach zone to the airport, for the “taking” of property through the creation of a flight easement. In addition, the flight easement utilized by airplanes was not
                        created by the passage of the ordinance, but by federal and state declarations of public navigability and by repeated overflights which preceded the home owner's action by considerably more than the 10 years allowed by the applicable

                        Where an injury involves a tort, being caused by the negligence of public officers or their agents, it cannot be said that property is taken or damaged for public use.

                        Where allegations of the plaintiffs make it clear the crushing of a sewer line and severing of a water main, with resulting damage to their property, were accidental and unintentional and certainly served no public purpose, there was absent a taking or
                        damaging of property for public use. Chavez v. Laramie, 389 P.2d 23, <cite class="wy_code">1964 Wyo. LEXIS 78</cite> (Wyo. 1964).

                        Under this section, property is damaged when it is made less valuable, less useful or less desirable. The measure of damages in such case is the difference between the fair market value before and after the inflicting of the damage. Hence, it is immaterial
                        whether such damage occurs by reason of the construction or the maintenance of a project, so long as it is directly attributable to such causative factor, and irrespective of whether there has been an actual physical taking of
                        any part of such property. The depreciation in value, however, must be by reason of damage to the land itself or to property rights therein. Personal inconvenience or discomfort to the owner, or interference with the business conducted
                        on the land, is not compensable unless such results are causative factors in the depreciation in the value of the land. Wyoming State Highway Dep't v. Napolitano, 578 P.2d 1342, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 291</cite>                        (Wyo. 1978).

                        The four aspects of the test for analyzing state constitution equal protection claims inquire as to (1) what class is harmed by the legislation and has that group been subjected to a tradition of disfavor by our laws; (2) what is the public purpose to
                        be served by the law; (3) what is the characteristic of the disadvantaged class that justifies disparate treatment; and (4) how are the characteristics used to distinguish people for disparate treatment relevant to the purpose

                            The distinction within the workers' compensation scheme between physically injured workers and workers with stress-related mental injuries is rationally related to the state's goal of efficiently and fairly distributing benefits while cutting costs for

                            Worker's Compensation Act (chapter 17 (now chapter 14) of title 27) does not unconstitutionally discriminate between partners and corporate officers. A partner is an employer and employee, whereas an officer is simply an employee; a rational basis exists,

                            Since corporations organized during territorial days became corporations of the state, it may at least be questioned whether this section would not be violated by a statute authorizing “any corporation, organized under any law of this state,” to have

                            Under the Mental Health Professions Practice Act, private counselors rights to equal protection have been transgressed; none of the evidence demonstrates that supervision by public, licensed counselors results in the qualification of counselors who are
                            more competent or more ethical and, thus, more likely to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The differentiation of the public employer or the charitable employer from the private, for-profit employer cannot
                            be justified as a proper classification and, thus, is not a legitimate exercise in police power. This classification is not founded on a reasonable basis, is arbitrary, and constitutes unwarranted discrimination. It is a violation
                            of equal protection and must be set aside. Allhusen v. State, 898 P.2d 878, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 106</cite> (Wyo. 1995), (decided prior to 2001 amendments to the Mental Health Professions

                        In a case where defendant challenged his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, the Wyoming Sex Offender Registration Act did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state constitutions because the effects of the Act did
                        not negate the legislature's intent to impose a regulatory scheme as it bore a rational connection to the goal of public safety by providing for identification of individuals convicted of sex offenses, and by making that information
                        available to law enforcement agencies and the general public; and its requirements constituted a reasonable method of achieving the goal of public safety. Kammerer v. State, 2014 WY 50, 322 P.3d 827,

                        The real question is whether the accused has been deprived of a substantial right by reason of the change in law. In re Jones, 500 P.2d 690, <cite class="wy_code">1972 Wyo. LEXIS 298</cite> (Wyo. 1972).

                        Changes which may be designated as mostly procedural do not, as a rule, come within the ex post facto doctrine. However, that in itself is not the true test; and a statute must be considered to be ex post facto and unconstitutional if it alters the situation
                        of the accused to his disadvantage. In re Jones, 500 P.2d 690, <cite class="wy_code">1972 Wyo. LEXIS 298</cite> (Wyo. 1972).

                        relating to mental illness or deficiency, as they existed after their 1983 amendments, effective on the above mentioned date. The defendant's psychiatric witness testified that the defendant could not resist his impulses at the

                    This section necessarily means the constitution of the United States as interpreted by the United States supreme court is controlling law in Wyoming. Torres v. Laramie County Sch.

                <p>
                    The primacy of the supreme court of the United States in constitutional areas is firmly embedded in the law by judicial decision and the state constitution. Doe v. Burk, 513 P.2d 643, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 177</cite>                    (Wyo. 1973).

                    There is no reason why the Wyoming supreme court should not apply Wyoming constitutional provisions in the administration of its jurisprudence, as long as they do not infringe upon the constitutional standards of the United States constitution. Richmond

                        directs or permits. Wyo. Const. art. 3, § 31 expressly requires the state treasurer’s approval of contracts for repairing and furnishing areas used by the legislature. Wyoming’s capitol restoration legislation assigns all aspects
                        of the project to the governor and other officials and groups created by the legislature. It, therefore, usurps the treasurer’s authority under Wyo. Const. art. 3, § 31 and violates the separation of powers provision of the Wyoming
                        Constitution. Gordon v. State, 2018 WY 32, 413 P.3d 1093, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 34</cite> (Wyo. 2018).

                        The fact that the low bidder could establish itself as qualified to do the work on a state project in the judgment of the trial court on the basis of post-award court proceedings was immaterial, given its lack of response or noncompliance with the prescribed
                        requirements of the proposal forms. Bids for public contracts must substantially comply with the requirements of the specifications for bidding and the directions to prospective bidders. The determination as to whether these requirements
                        are satisfied and the awarding of a contract are acts of discretion which will be enjoined only if done illegally, arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably. State v. Weisz &amp; Sons, 713 P.2d 176,

                    <p>
                        The executive department, not the judicial department, has the power to decide whether to defer prosecution under § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.07.html#t07c13a03s7-13-301" target="_blank">7-13-301</a></cite> (placing
                        guilty, unconvicted, person on probation). The exercise of that prosecutorial discretion is not subject to judicial review as long as any unjustifiable or suspect factors such as race, religion or other arbitrary or discriminatory
                        classification are not involved. Thus, the requirement that the state consent to the court's deferral of further proceedings and placement of defendants on probation without entry of a judgment of conviction does not infringe on
                        the judicial department's sentencing power in violation of the principle of separation of powers explicitly stated in this section. Billis v. State, 800 P.2d 401, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 119</cite> (Wyo. 1990), reh'g

                        might have permitted the parole board to perform both legislative and judicial functions by allowing the board to extend the period of his possible parole in the event he failed to make restitution. Because the board had not yet
                        exercised its statutory authority, however, the issue raised was not ripe for review. The defendant could seek review when he could demonstrate that the board had made some adverse decision. Brenning v. State, 870 P.2d 349,

                        Although the surrender of a driver's license as a part of the penalty defined by the legislature for driving while intoxicated can be the function of the court imposing sentence, the legislature has not seen fit to include suspension or revocation of
                        drivers' licenses as part of the criminal penalty, and therefore the provisions in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.31.html#t31c05a02s31-5-233ol1e" target="_blank">31-5-233(e)</a></cite> (prior

                    ordains the law. The latter merely prescribes means and methods for its application. Bulova Watch Co. v. Zale Jewelry Co., 371 P.2d 409, <cite class="wy_code">1962 Wyo. LEXIS 85</cite> (Wyo. 1962).

                    The disposition of the judicial branch of government has always been to scrupulously refrain from encroaching in the slightest way into the legislative field of policy making where factual or economic factors require latitude of discretion. The courts

                        The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution of the United States requires that both houses of a bicameral state legislature be apportioned substantially on a population basis. However, mathematical exactness is not required,
                        so long as the divergences from a strict population standard are based on legitimate considerations incident to the effectuation of a rational state policy. The foregoing rules are applicable regardless of whether the scheme for
                        representation in either house of a bicameral state legislature results from statutory or constitutional provisions. Schaefer v. Thomson, 240 F. Supp. 247, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7892 (D. Wyo. 1964).

                        The conditions and circumstances existing in Wyoming are such that the provisions of this section, which constitute each county an election district and require that each county be represented by at least one senator, are ineffective and are not to be

                        The conditions and circumstances existing in Wyoming are such that literal compliance with the provisions of this section would produce a result that would be wholly unreasonable, untenable and impractical. The end result of literal compliance would be
                        a legislature substantially in excess of 300 members. However, it is obvious that the Wyoming constitutional convention which agreed upon a state constitution intended that the legislative bodies should be comparatively small.
                        It could not have envisioned such an absurd result as would be brought about if the state senate is constituted with each county as a senatorial election district and the county with the least population fixing as near as may be
                        the minimum unit for district representation. Schaefer v. Thomson, 240 F. Supp. 247, 1964 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7892 (D. Wyo. 1964).

                    <p>
                        As a general matter, an apportionment plan for state legislative districts with a maximum population deviation under 10 percent falls within the category of minor deviations. A plan with larger disparities in population, however, creates a prima facie
                        case of discrimination and therefore must be justified by the state. The ultimate inquiry is whether the legislature's plan may reasonably be said to advance a rational state policy and, if so, whether the population disparities
                        among the districts that have resulted from the pursuit of this plan exceed constitutional limits. Brown v. Thomson, 462 U.S. 835, 103 S. Ct. 2690, 77 L. Ed. 2d 214, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 78 (U.S. 1983).

                        it is undisputed that Wyoming has applied this factor in a manner free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination. Brown v. Thomson, 462 U.S. 835, 103 S. Ct. 2690, 77 L. Ed. 2d 214, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 78 (U.S. 1983).

                        of this section and art. 3, § 18, Wyo. Const., which relate to impeachment of state and judicial officers. In re Johnson, 568 P.2d 855, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 313</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

                        The supreme court was unable to consider acts occurring in a justice's prior term to be, in and of themselves, grounds for removal; however, such acts were considered as evidential facts bearing upon the justice's general course of conduct during his
                        present term — especially as they related to motive and intent concerning acts charged to him during his current term. In re Johnson, 568 P.2d 855, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 313</cite> (Wyo.

                        same bill or initiative of unrelated and separate subjects that have nothing to do with the subject of the original legislation. Wyoming Nat'l Abortion Rights Action League v. Karpan, 881 P.2d 281,

                            Aside from the fact that ch. 194, Laws 1963, as passed, contains provisions beyond the subject expressed in its title, it also appears that both the title and the body of the act itself embrace two distinct objects, in contravention of this section, namely:

                            “An act to define the judicial districts of the state and prescribing the time for holding the terms of the district court in the several counties of each judicial district” sufficiently expressed the subject matter of the act. In re Board of Comm'rs,

                            was not invalid under this section. Board of Comm'rs v. Stone, 7 Wyo. 280, 51 P. 605, <cite class="wy_code">1898 Wyo. LEXIS 3</cite> (Wyo. 1898).

                            Provision for preference contained in “An act to expedite and simplify the collection and payment by banks of checks and other instruments for the payment of money” was sufficiently embraced in title, as giving such preference is at least one of the means
                            to further and accomplish the main purpose or one of the main purposes of the act. In re Riverton State Bank, 48 Wyo. 372, 49 P.2d 637, <cite class="wy_code">1935 Wyo. LEXIS 44</cite> (Wyo. 1935).

                            No one who read the title to ch. 93, Laws 1955, and was thus aware of the passage of the law could reasonably claim to have been misled since the statement by fair implication advised all citizens that inclusive rules and regulations for fire protection
                            would be adopted. Brinegar v. Clark, 371 P.2d 62, <cite class="wy_code">1962 Wyo. LEXIS 82</cite> (Wyo. 1962).

                            The fact that the title of ch. 204, Laws 1957, did not mention the right of a representative of a deceased spouse to elect to take against a will would not invalidate it under this section since the subject matter of the amended section is germane to
                            the election rights of surviving spouses contained in the original section. Morrow v. Diefenderfer, 384 P.2d 601, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 103</cite> (Wyo. 1963).

                            The title to ch. 91, Laws 1965, “An act concerning the refunding of public securities” embraces the subject of the advance escrow-type refunding provisions of said act in all particulars and expresses said subject with sufficient clarity so as to comply
                            with this section. Rodin v. State, 417 P.2d 180, <cite class="wy_code">1966 Wyo. LEXIS 155</cite> (Wyo. 1966).

                        It is duty of the court, where an act is questioned, to examine the legislative journals to determine whether or not such act was passed by a majority of the members elected to each house, that being a matter which the constitution requires to be shown
                        by the journals. State ex rel. Cheyenne v. Swan, 7 Wyo. 166, 51 P. 209, <cite class="wy_code">1897 Wyo. LEXIS 22</cite> (Wyo. 1897).

                        The enrolled bill as signed by the officers of the legislature and the governor is not conclusive on the courts, and the legislative journals may be consulted to determine whether the act has been passed in conformity with the constitutional requirements.

                            Wyoming had authority to impose reasonable regulations in state educational institutions, and requirement of accreditation of private degree-granting educational institutions was a reasonable restriction, adopted to ensure that quality education was being
                            provided by a private entity licensed in Wyoming; to the extent the accreditation process required a contract between the university and the accrediting entity, need of the state to protect citizens outweighed contract rights

                            Under the Mental Health Professions Practice Act, private counselors rights to equal protection have been transgressed; none of the evidence demonstrates that supervision by public, licensed counselors results in the qualification of counselors who are
                            more competent or more ethical and, thus, more likely to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The differentiation of the public employer or the charitable employer from the private, for-profit employer cannot
                            be justified as a proper classification and, thus, is not a legitimate exercise in police power. This classification is not founded on a reasonable basis, is arbitrary, and constitutes unwarranted discrimination. It is a violation

                    Violation of this section. — Wyo. Const. art. 2, § 1 prohibits any person or collection of persons charged with exercising the powers belonging to one of the three branches of government from exercising powers properly belonging to another branch, except
                    as the Constitution expressly directs or permits. Wyo. Const. art. 3, § 31 expressly requires the state treasurer's approval of contracts for repairing and furnishing areas used by the legislature. Wyoming's capitol restoration legislation
                    assigns all aspects of the project to the governor and other officials and groups created by the legislature. It, therefore, usurps the treasurer's authority under Wyo. Const. art. 3, § 31 and violates the separation of powers provision

                        Section 10, ch. 202, Laws 1975, which appropriated funds for the administration of the Wyoming community development authority, did not violate this section on the ground that said section was not related to ordinary expenses of the legislative, executive
                        and judicial departments of the state and should be enacted by separate bill embracing one subject, since there is no constitutional limitation on the creation of a separate body corporate, as a state instrumentality, to perform
                        governmental functions having a public purpose. With that right goes the implied authority to lend financial support for purely administrative purposes. Witzenburger v.

                        by a majority of the electors.

                        The proposed amendment provided that amendments to the Wyoming Constitution proposed by the legislature would be submitted to the electors of the state of Wyoming without prior approval by the governor. The amendment was not ratified by a majority of
                        electors at the November 5, 2002 general election.

                        amendment did not meet the requirement of approval from a majority of the total ballots cast.

       § 53. Creation of criminal penalties not subject to governor's power to commute.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding Article 4, Section 5 of this Constitution, the legislature may by law create a penalty of life imprisonment without parole for specified crimes which sentence shall not be subject to commutation by the governor. The legislature may in
                    addition limit commutation of a death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment without parole which sentence shall not be subject to further commutation. In no event shall the inherent power of the governor to grant a pardon be
                    limited or curtailed. (Added by 1993 Senate JR 4, ratified in 1994.)

                    the legislature shall either pardon, or commute the sentence, direct the execution of the sentence or grant further reprieve. He shall communicate to the legislature at each regular session each case of remission of fine, reprieve,

                        Governor's appointment after incumbent's term expired became valid on incumbent's death to extent incumbent had right to office until successor qualified. However, since senate did not confirm appointment, and since appointment for regular term could
                        not be made without consent of senate, appointee's name or that of someone to succeed him should go to senate at next session, and such person when confirmed would serve for balance of term which commenced when term of deceased

                        The legislature may provide for such other state officers not enumerated in the constitution as are deemed necessary, and it seems that in the creation of such officers the governor may be vested by law with the sole power of appointing them, dispensing
                        with the consent of the senate. Such, however, has not been the habit of the state or territorial legislatures in creating new offices, as such officials are generally required by the statutes to be appointed by the governor by
                        and with the advice and consent of the senate, except only in case of vacancies. State ex rel. Richardson v. Henderson, 4 Wyo. 535, 35 P. 517, <cite class="wy_code">1894 Wyo. LEXIS 8</cite> (Wyo. 1894).

                        Power of the legislature to “prescribe by law” is not unrestricted; laws may be enacted that do not interfere with the constitutional or inherent authority of the courts, but statutes that interfere with that authority are unconstitutional, and this concept

                        Since a lower court does have authority to close pretrial hearings under certain circumstances, a test of the court's jurisdiction to do so through an application for writ of prohibition is inappropriate, as the issuance of such a writ is closely guarded

                            The writ of certiorari is a common-law writ, and under the power conferred by the constitution, the supreme court has authority to issue it, at least in cases not coming within the operation of the statute abolishing it, subject to the conditions and

                            There is no inhibition in the court rules, the state constitution or any legislative mandate that precludes the supreme court from, on its own motion, considering a notice of appeal as a petition for writ of certiorari and proceeding with review on that
                            basis. Whenever the court determines that review by certiorari is in the best interest of the state, or its citizens, it may be invoked. In re General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water, 803 P.2d 61,

                            Although a district court's order annulling a municipal candidate's election was not appealable because it granted only partial summary judgment and was not certified as immediately appealable by the district court, the supreme court converted the notice
                            of appeal into a writ of review because the issues raised presented questions of significant state importance. Smith v. Brito, 2007 WY 191, 173 P.3d 351, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 203</cite>                            (Wyo. 2007).

       § 5. Voluntary retirement and compensation of justices and judges.

                <p>
                    Subject to the further provisions of this section, the legislature shall provide for the voluntary retirement and compensation of justices and judges of the supreme court and district courts, and may do so for any other courts, on account of length of
                    service, age and disability, and for their reassignment to active duty where and when needed. The office of every such justice and judge shall become vacant when the incumbent reaches the age of seventy (70) years, as the legislature
                    may prescribe; but, in the case of an incumbent whose term of office includes the effective date of this amendment, this provision shall not prevent him from serving the remainder of said term nor be applicable to him before his period
                    or periods of judicial service shall have reached a total of six (6) years. The legislature may also provide for benefits for dependents of justices and judges. (As amended by Laws 1971, House Joint Resolution No. 1, p. 719.)

                        The district court improperly dismissed a criminal appeal from the county court because the notice of appeal was not filed on time. The case was remanded to the district court for an evidentiary hearing to determine if fault for the late notice of appeal
                        was that of the defendant or of his counsel, with instructions that, if the court found that the fault was attributable to counsel, it could invoke the common-law writ of certiorari pursuant to this section. Foote v. State, 751

                        power to restrain execution upon a judgment which would result in an injustice, such error was rendered harmless by the judge's subsequent written order which found that the value of the judgment was unknown beyond the amount realized
                        at the execution sale and that the eventual settlement amount received was the result of an increase in value after its execution sale. Wheatland Cold Storage &amp; Meat Processing v. Wilkins, 705 P.2d 316,

                        There is no need to ascertain the “characteristic common law duties” of the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction because Wyoming's constitutional framers expressly entrusted the power of “general supervision of the public schools”

                        Senate Enrolled Act 1 (Laws 2013, Chapter 1) is unconstitutional, as it deprives the State Superintendent of Public Instruction the power of “general supervision of the public schools” that is entrusted to the Superintendent. Powers v. State, 2014 WY

                        through legislation what it may only do through the constitutional amendment process; therefore, the act is unconstitutional. Powers v.

                        who may serve as trustees. Sections 1 and 2 state as follows: Section 1. The following proposal to amend Wyoming Constitution, Article 7, Section 17 is proposed for submission to the electors of the State of Wyoming at the next
                        general election for approval or rejection to become valid as a part of the Constitution if ratified by a majority of the electors at the election: Article 7, Section 17. Government of university. The legislature shall provide

                        president of the university, and the superintendent of public instruction, as members ex officio, as such having the right to speak, but not to vote. The duties and powers of the trustees shall be prescribed by law. Not more than
                        twenty percent (20%) of the appointed trustees may be nonresidents of the state, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 6, Section 15 of this Constitution. Section 2. That the Secretary of State shall endorse the following statement
                        on the proposed amendment: The adoption of this amendment would allow the governor to appoint nonresidents of the state to serve as University of Wyoming trustees. Not more than twenty percent (20%) of the appointed trustees may
                        be nonresidents of the state. The governor would not be required to appoint any nonresident as a trustee. All appointments to the board of trustees are with the advice and consent of the Wyoming Senate.

                        assistance of the courts in a suit for the administration of the decree. The role of the state engineer was not to apply state law, but to enforce the reserved rights against state appropriators, as decreed under principles of

                        through, over and across the owner's lands; that the waters of the river are the property of the state and are held by it in trust for the equal use and benefit of the public; and that the waters of the river may be used by the

                    Since indemnity agreements are widely used in construction-related industries, the legislature may consider that such use removes or reduces the incentives to protect workers and others from personal injury and for these reasons declare them to be against
                    public policy. To attempt to achieve such purposes by voiding certain indemnity agreements is certainly reasonable and within the purpose of the police power. Mountain Fuel Supply Co. v. Emerson, 578 P.2d 1351,

                        about the identity of his actual employer is not necessarily prejudiced, but must affirmatively demonstrate either that the employee suffered harm because of being mistaken about the identity of his employer, or that his mistake

                    A foreign corporation, shipping in refrigerator equipment from another state, under agreement to install same, was not doing business in the state so as to preclude it from repossessing it upon default of purchaser, but was engaged in interstate commerce

                <p>
                    The legislature shall provide by general law for organizing new counties, locating the county seats thereof temporarily and changing county lines. But no new county shall be formed unless it shall contain within the limits thereof property of the valuation
                    of two million dollars, as shown by last preceding tax returns, and not then unless the remaining portion of the old county or counties shall each contain property of at least three million dollars of assessable valuation; and no new
                    county shall be organized nor shall any organized county be so reduced as to contain a population of less than one thousand five hundred bona fide inhabitants, and in case any portion of an organized county or counties is stricken
                    off to form a new county, the new county shall assume and be holden for an equitable proportion of the indebtedness of the county or counties so reduced. No county shall be divided unless a majority of the qualified electors of the
                    territory proposed to be cut off voting on the proposition shall vote in favor of the division.

                        ordinance passed by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of all members elected to the governing body of the city or town. Each such charter ordinance shall be titled and may provide that the whole or any part of any statute, which would otherwise

                        week for two consecutive weeks in the official city or town newspaper, if any, otherwise in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. No charter ordinance shall take effect until the sixtieth (60th) day after its

                        in the office of the clerk of such city or town, demanding that such ordinance be submitted to referendum, then the ordinance shall not take effect unless approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. Such referendum election
                        shall be called within thirty (30) days and held within ninety (90) days after the petition is filed. An ordinance establishing procedures, and fixing the date of such election shall be passed by the governing body and published
                        once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in the official city or town newspaper, if any, otherwise in a newspaper of general circulation in the city or town. The question on the ballot shall be: “Shall Charter Ordinance No.

                        shall take effect if approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon. An approved charter ordinance, after becoming effective, shall be recorded by the clerk in a book maintained for that purpose with a certificate of the
                        procedures of adoption. A certified copy of the ordinance shall be filed with the secretary of state, who shall keep an index of such ordinances. Each charter ordinance enacted shall prevail over any prior act of the governing
                        body of the city or town, and may be repealed or amended only by subsequent charter ordinance, or by enactments of the legislature applicable to all cities and towns.

                        It is quite apparent the framers of the constitution thought that a direct tax of eight mills against the property of the city or town (together with indirect taxes permitted) would and should suffice for the payment of expenses incurred in performing
                        the governmental functions essential to the convenience, safety and happiness of the citizens of the municipality, rather than the welfare of the general public. It is hardly probable they contemplated that this limitation should
                        be evaded either directly or indirectly and that a direct tax greater than eight mills could be imposed upon such property for the performance of these functions. War Memorial Hosp. of Dist. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 73 Wyo.

                        to direct it; and the assessor correctly reasoned that the recentness of the purchase obviated the need to do an economic obsolescence calculation because the 1998 value was derived from an arms length transaction, was provided
                        by the taxpayer, and fairly included economic obsolescence in 2001. Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Campbell County, 2006 WY 44, 132 P.3d 801, <cite class="wy_code">2006 Wyo. LEXIS 47</cite> (Wyo. 2006).

                        that the Department had consistently applied the statute to locate Wyoming mine mouths at the point where the minerals actually reached the surface. Wyodak Res. Dev. Corp. v. Wyo. Dep't of Revenue, 2017 WY 6, 387 P.3d 725,

                        Although intangible personal property is exempt from taxation, it may add value to taxable, tangible property, and to that extent, it should be included in any assessment in order to properly reflect the true value of the property; in utilizing the unitary
                        method, however, to the extent that intangible property has value beyond any enhancing effect on tangible property and is separable from those assets, it must be excluded. RT Communs. v. State Bd. of Equalization, 11 P.3d 915,

                        There was no rational basis for treating non-profit electric utilities differently from investor-owned utilities for purposes of ad valorem taxation, and therefore valuation of rural electric cooperative's property constituted an abuse of discretion and

                        The mere renting of buildings to a lessee engaged in a profit-making venture is not of itself a use for nongovernmental purposes. It depends upon the circumstances. The test is whether or not those buildings were primarily used and being so used as reasonably
                        necessary or essential facilities to the efficient operation and maintenance of the airport. If so, the improvements were not subject to taxation. City of Cheyenne v. Board of County Comm'rs, 484 P.2d 706,

                        In considering whether or not as a general proposition buildings owned by a municipality and located upon its airport and used primarily for the housing, care, repair and service of aircraft can be said to constitute a “governmental purpose” the supreme
                        court is impressed with the fact that the legislature apparently regarded such facilities as an essential or necessary adjunct to an airport. The mere fact that the city accomplished such use through a lessee or received rent in
                        return for such use is not controlling. City of Cheyenne v. Board of County Comm'rs, 484 P.2d 706, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 215</cite> (Wyo. 1971).

                        A “fixed base operation” is a necessary adjunct to the operation of an airport. That being true, it reasonably follows that city-owned buildings leased for use in such an operation were “used primarily for a governmental purpose” within the reach of the

                    This article prevents a county treasurer from diverting the principal amount of taxes collected for a school district. Thus, because interest is an accretion or increment of the principal fund earning it and the interest follows the fund, the county treasurer,
                    as soon as the funds are collected, should designate the principal and interest to the school district. Board of County Comm'rs v. Laramie County Sch. Dist. No. One, 884 P.2d 946, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 144</cite>                    (Wyo. 1994).

                <p>
                    There shall be levied each year in each county of the state a tax of not to exceed six (6) mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the property in each county for the support and maintenance of the public schools. This tax shall be collected
                    by the county treasurer and disbursed among the school districts within the county as the legislature shall provide. The legislature may authorize boards of trustees of school districts to levy a special tax on the property of the
                    district. The legislature may also provide for the distribution among one (1) or more school districts of any revenue from the special school district property tax in excess of a state average yield, which shall be calculated each
                    year, per average daily membership. (As added by Laws 1965, Senate Joint Resolution No. 10, p. 520; as amended by Laws 1981, House Joint Resolution No. 3, p. 329; Laws 2006, Senate Joint Resolution No. 1.)

                        If there is no present legal potential that an obligation will have to be paid from revenues resulting from the exercise by a governmental entity of its power to tax, the obligation is not a debt within the constitutional provisions relative to the amount

                        “Revenue bond” or “special fund” doctrine, constitutionally, does not incur debt. Under this doctrine, if an obligation is payable solely from revenues resulting from the project for which the obligation was incurred and not from taxes, a debt within

                        Only way to conform to prohibition of this section and art. 16, § 2, Wyo. Const., is to stay within their clear limits without an election or submit the debt proposition to a vote of the people for approval. To hold otherwise would be to unlock the doors

                <p>
                    No debt in excess of the taxes for the current year, shall in any manner be created in the State of Wyoming, unless the proposition to create such debt shall have been submitted to a vote of the people and by them approved; except to suppress insurrection

                    Basic intent and purpose of this section, limiting incurrence of state debt beyond the current year's taxes, is to prohibit the legislature from binding subsequent legislatures to make appropriations of money in subsequent fiscal years. Witzenburger v.

                    Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from persons and property, levied by the state by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and all public needs.

                    Only way to conform to prohibition of this section and art. 16, § 1, Wyo. Const., is to stay within their clear limits without an election or submit the debt proposition to a vote of the people for approval. To hold otherwise would be to unlock the doors
                    and grant the legislature unbridled authority to create debt without limitation, contrary to what the state's founding fathers, with approval of the people, conceived to be reasonable restraints. Witzenburger v. State, 575 P.2d 1100,

                    A debt is unconstitutional when, if income from an authorized source is insufficient, the remainder must be paid out of tax money of the state. Witzenburger v.

                        limitation imposed upon such rights. Wyoming State Highway Dep't v. Napolitano, 578 P.2d 1342, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 291</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

                    such appraisement the value of improvements shall not be taken into consideration. If, at any time hereafter, the United States shall grant any arid lands in the state to the state, on the condition that the state reclaim and dispose

                        A sale and an exchange are two different concepts with different legal significance attached to each. What Wyoming's framers intended when they required a public auction for a sale of school lands was to prevent school lands from being exploited for private
                        advantage, but there is no need to read the these Constitutional clauses to impose the same restrictions on transfers in which the abuses they were intended to prevent are not likely to occur. Dir. of the Office of State Lands

                        A sale and an exchange are two different concepts with different legal significance attached to each; otherwise, the words would be synonyms for each other with no legal difference. What Wyoming's framers intended when they required a public auction for
                        a sale of school lands was to prevent school lands from being exploited for private advantage, and there was no need to read these constitutional clauses to impose the same restrictions on transfers in which the abuses they were
                        intended to prevent were not likely to occur, and in which the trust may in another and more effective fashion be assured full compensation. Therefore, it could not be concluded that the framers of the Wyoming Constitution intended
                        a public auction must occur before the state can exchange school lands for lands of equal value. Dir. of the Office of State Lands &amp; Invs. v.

                    delay (not less than the time fixed by congress) in portions at proper intervals of time, and at such minimum prices (not less than the minimum fixed by congress) as to realize the largest possible proceeds. And said board, subject

                        In leasing state lands, board exercises wide discretion which should be controlling except in case of illegal exercise thereof, or fraud or grave abuse of such discretion.

                        The discretion of the board in both the leasing and the sale of school lands of this state has been given a very broad scope, subject only to the limitation that review by the courts may be had of its action in the event of the board's transgression of
                        provisions of positive law, fraud or having committed a grave abuse of that discretion. Whether the board has exceeded this limitation must be determined from the varying circumstances of individual cases. Mayor v. Board of Land

                        The constitution which creates the board of land commissioners grants broad authority which is to be exercised “under direction of the legislature as limited by this constitution.” Under this provision, the legislature is authorized to establish rules
                        and methods which will govern the board within constitutional limits, but any statutes passed under this authority must if effective to control a controverted point be clear and definite. When there is no such direction the board
                        must exercise its best judgment with which the courts may not interfere except in cases of illegal exercise of discretion, or fraud. Mahoney v. L. L. Sheep Co., 79 Wyo. 293, 333 P.2d 712, <cite class="wy_code">1958 Wyo. LEXIS 46</cite>                        (Wyo. 1958).

                        A sale and an exchange are two different concepts with different legal significance attached to each; otherwise, the words would be synonyms for each other with no legal difference. What Wyoming's framers intended when they required a public auction for
                        a sale of school lands was to prevent school lands from being exploited for private advantage, and there was no need to read these constitutional clauses to impose the same restrictions on transfers in which the abuses they were
                        intended to prevent were not likely to occur, and in which the trust may in another and more effective fashion be assured full compensation. Therefore, it could not be concluded that the framers of the Wyoming Constitution intended
                        a public auction must occur before the state can exchange school lands for lands of equal value. Dir. of the Office of State Lands &amp; Invs. v.

                <p>
                    The legislature may provide by law for the voluntary submission of differences to arbitrators for determination and said arbitrators shall have such powers and duties as may be prescribed by law; but they shall have no power to render judgment to be obligatory
                    on parties; unless they voluntarily submit their matters of difference and agree to abide the judgment of such arbitrators.

                    This section only bars state jurisdiction over Indian water rights when federal law also bars that jurisdiction. Congress' policy under the federal McCarran Amendment is to allow state courts to adjudicate Indian water rights as part of general stream
                    adjudications. Because of the McCarran Amendment, there is no federal law which prevents the state from adjudicating the Indian water rights on the In re General Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in Big Horn River Sys., 753 P.2d
