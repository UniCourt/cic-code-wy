The application shall state who the officers, directors and stockholders are at that time and have attached evidence that appropriate federal insurance of deposits has been obtained, where applicable. The state banking commissioner shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days after the application has been filed, but the authority of the state banking commissioner to disapprove any application is restricted solely to noncompliance with this section. If the state banking commissioner approves the application, he shall issue a certificate of authority to the organizers within twenty (20) days. If the state banking commissioner denies the application, he shall mail a notice of denial to the organizers within twenty (20) days, stating the reasons for denying the application, and grant to the organizers a maximum period of ninety (90) days to resubmit the application with the necessary corrections. If the applicant fails to comply with requirements of the notice of denial within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the notice, the approval of the application and articles of incorporation previously issued to the applying institution shall be revoked by the state banking commissioner. The failure of the state banking commissioner to act upon an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days shall be deemed an approval. If the approved institution fails to commence business in good faith within one (1) year after the issuance of a certificate of authority by the state banking commissioner or any required federal approval, whichever is later, the charter and certificate of authority shall expire.

     <p>
      The commissioner may take joint enforcement actions with any other bank supervisory agency having concurrent jurisdiction over any branch in Wyoming of an out-of-state bank or any branch of a Wyoming state bank in any host state or may take such action independently if the commissioner deems the actions to be necessary or appropriate to carry out his responsibilities under this article or to ensure compliance with the laws of this state. In the case of an out-of-state state bank, the commissioner shall recognize the exclusive authority of the home state supervisor over corporate governance matters and the primary responsibility of the home state supervisor with respect to safety and soundness matters. If the commissioner determines that a branch maintained by an out-of-state state bank in this state, or a branch of a Wyoming bank operating in another state, is being operated in violation of any provision of the laws of this state, or that the branch is being operated in an unsafe and unsound manner, the commissioner shall have the authority to take all the enforcement actions as he would be empowered to take if the branch were a Wyoming state bank; provided, that the commissioner shall promptly give notice to the home state supervisor or host state supervisor, as applicable, of each enforcement action taken against an out-of-state bank and, to the extent practicable, shall consult and cooperate with the home state supervisor in pursuing and resolving the enforcement action.

       Every bank is subject to the inspection of the state banking commissioner. The state banking commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall visit and examine each bank as often as the commissioner deems necessary and at least as frequently as required by the federal deposit insurance corporation, with or without previous notice to the officers of or anyone interested in the bank. The state banking commissioner or a duly appointed examiner shall make a complete and careful examination of the condition and resources of the bank, the mode of managing bank affairs and conducting its business, the action of bank officers and directors in the investment and disposition of bank funds, the safety and prudence of bank management, the security afforded to those by whom bank engagements are held, whether the requirements of this act are being complied with and such other matters as the state banking commissioner may prescribe. If the state banking commissioner examines a bank more than twice in any calendar year, the bank shall pay to the state banking commissioner an additional fee established by rule and regulation of the commissioner.

Such fees shall be established by regulation of the state banking commissioner and shall be adjusted by regulations issued by the state banking commissioner to assure consistency with the cost of supervision and the fees paid by national banks. Other fees assessed for administrative services caused by applications or activities attributable to a specific financial institution or entity, shall be used to defray the cost of the special services and, to the extent possible, shall be recovered from the financial institution or entity which requires the special service.

Written notice of the deficiency and the amount of the assessment shall be provided to each shareholder, and may be provided by electronic transmission, consistent with W.S. 17-16-141(c). If any shareholder fails to pay the assessment within thirty (30) days of receiving notice, the directors of the bank may sell the stock of the shareholder to the highest bidder at public auction. Notice of the sale shall be published for ten (10) days in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county where the bank is located and a copy of the notice of sale shall be served on the owner of the stock personally or by mail at his last known address ten (10) days before the day of sale. The stock may be sold at private sale without public notice. Before a private sale an offer in writing shall first be obtained and a copy of the offer served upon the owner of record of the stock either personally or by mailing a copy of the offer to his last known address. If, after service of the offer, the owner still fails to pay the assessment within two (2) weeks from the time of the service of the offer, the directors may accept the private offer or a larger offer.

Out of the proceeds of the sale the directors shall pay the assessment and the cost of sale and the balance shall be paid to the person whose stock has been sold. A sale of stock cancels the outstanding certificate evidencing the stock sold. A new certificate shall be issued by the bank to the purchaser.

      <li id="t13c05a04s13-5-419ol1a">
       A supervised trust company may voluntarily dissolve in the manner provided herein. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either liquidating the supervised trust company or reorganizing the supervised trust company into a domestic or foreign corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or limited liability partnership that does not engage in trust company business. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the commissioner shall revoke the supervised trust company’s charter and thereafter the company may not use the word “trust” in its business name or in connection with its business and may not conduct trust company business.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c05a04s13-5-419ol1b">
       A supervised trust company seeking to dissolve its charter either by liquidation or reorganization shall file an application for dissolution with the commissioner accompanied by a filing fee established by rule and regulation of the commissioner. The application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the supervised trust company’s known and unknown claims and liabilities and for the transfer of all of its responsibilities as a trustee to a successor trustee or trustees. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence, certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require demonstrating how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition of the assets and liabilities and the applicant’s proposal for addressing any claims that are asserted after the dissolution has been completed. The commissioner shall examine the application for completeness and compliance with the requirements of this section, the business entity laws applicable to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules and regulations. The commissioner may conduct a special examination of the applicant for purposes of evaluating the application.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c05a04s13-5-419ol1c">
       If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to be complete by the commissioner, not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application. If the commissioner approves the application, the applicant may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan outlined in the application, subject to any conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the applicant subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, the applicant may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c05a04s13-5-419ol1d">
       Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the applicant shall submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the supervised trust company to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution. Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the applicant shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The applicant shall then file articles of dissolution and other documents required by W.S. 17-16-1401 through 17-16-1440 for a corporation or required by W.S. 17-29-701 through 17-29-708 for a limited liability company, in the office of the secretary of state. In the case of reorganization, the applicant shall also file the documents required by the secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.

The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence that the additional actions have been taken. The commissioner may extend the deadline for good cause shown. If the applicant fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the applicant in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not approved, and the applicant may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.

     <p>
      If the application is approved and a charter granted by the board, the public trust company shall not commence business before receiving a certificate of authority to operate from the commissioner. An application for a certificate of authority shall be made to the commissioner and shall certify that all required capital and surplus have been paid in. The application shall list the address at which the public trust company will operate and shall attach the organizational instrument or all adopted bylaws. The application shall state who the officers, directors and stockholders or the members and managers are at that time. The commissioner shall approve or deny an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days after the application has been filed, but the authority of the commissioner to disapprove any application is restricted solely to noncompliance with this section. If the commissioner approves the application, he shall issue a certificate of authority to the organizers within twenty (20) days. If the commissioner denies the application, he shall mail a notice of denial to the organizers within twenty (20) days, stating the reasons for denying the application, and grant to the organizers a maximum period of ninety (90) days to resubmit the application with the necessary corrections. If the applicant fails to comply with requirements of the notice of denial within ninety (90) days from the receipt of the notice, the approval of the application and charter previously issued to the applying public trust company shall be revoked by the commissioner. The failure of the commissioner to act upon an application for a certificate of authority within thirty (30) days shall be deemed an approval. If the approved public trust company fails to commence business in good faith within one (1) year after the issuance of a certificate of authority by the commissioner or any required federal approval, whichever is later, the charter and certificate of authority shall expire.

       Any state savings and loan association may borrow money from the federal home loan bank, when authorized by resolution of its board of directors, upon terms and rates of interest as may be agreed upon. It may assign and pledge its notes, bonds, mortgages or other property and repledge the shares of stock or savings certificates pledged to it as collateral security without securing the consent of the owner as security for the repayment of its indebtedness. Any lawful holder of any evidence of indebtedness due to an association may enforce, in his own name or in the name of the association, all appropriate remedies to enforce collection, whether or not the stock or savings certificate described in connection with the note is held by the pledgee or holder.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c07a04s13-7-402ol1b">
       Any obligation incurred or loan made by an association constitutes a claim against the corporate assets and is payable in advance of, and by preference over, all claims or rights of the shareholders or holders of savings certificates in any of the assets of the association. These obligations are senior to any demand for the withdrawal or cancellation of all classes of shares or savings certificates in the association including matured shares or savings certificates.
      </li>
      <li id="t13c07a04s13-7-402ol1c">
       The existence of a withdrawal list consisting of members desiring to withdraw from the association does not prevent the board of directors of the association from borrowing money from the federal home loan bank to be used solely for the purpose of making mortgage loans to the members of the association, but all borrowed money shall be exclusively used for the purpose borrowed. A savings and loan association shall not at any time borrow money from the federal home loan bank in an amount exceeding any limit fixed by the laws of this state.

      For every loan made, except a loan from one (1) association to another, a note or bond specifying the amount loaned and the rate of interest and premium to be paid, secured by first mortgage on improved real estate, shall be taken. A complete abstract of title for the real estate signed by the person or corporation furnishing the abstract which shall be examined by a competent attorney-at-law and his opinion furnished approving the title and showing that the mortgage is a first lien, or a policy of title insurance of a reliable title insurance company authorized to issue insurance on titles within this state, or a duplicate certificate of ownership issued by a registrar of titles, shall be furnished. No mortgage loan shall be made except upon the report in writing of an appraiser or a committee of appraisers appointed by the board of directors which shall state the conservative value of the mortgage security. The directors may also loan upon the security of savings on deposit in the association to the amount of ninety percent (90%) of their withdrawal value, and may loan upon or invest in bonds of the United States and the state of Wyoming, in real property loans insured by the federal housing administration or guaranteed by the veterans administration, and in classes of bonds and warrants of the counties, school districts and other municipalities, as well as local improvement districts in this state, as the state banking commissioner may from time to time approve but no association shall loan any of its funds to an officer or director of the association.

       A special purpose depository institution may voluntarily dissolve in accordance with the provisions of this section. Voluntary dissolution shall be accomplished by either liquidating the special purpose depository institution or reorganizing the institution into an appropriate business entity that does not engage in any activity authorized only for a special purpose depository institution. Upon complete liquidation or completion of the reorganization, the commissioner shall revoke the charter of the special purpose depository institution and afterward, the company shall not use the word “special purpose depository institution” or “bank” in its business name or in connection with its ongoing business.

       The special purpose depository institution may dissolve its charter either by liquidation or reorganization. The board of directors shall file an application for dissolution with the commissioner, accompanied by a filing fee established by rule of the commissioner. The application shall include a comprehensive plan for dissolution setting forth the proposed disposition of all assets and liabilities, in reasonable detail to effect a liquidation or reorganization, and any other plans required by the commissioner. The plan of dissolution shall provide for the discharge or assumption of all of the known and unknown claims and liabilities of the special purpose depository institution. Additionally, the application for dissolution shall include other evidence, certifications, affidavits, documents or information as the commissioner may require, including demonstration of how assets and liabilities will be disposed, the timetable for effecting disposition of the assets and liabilities and a proposal of the special purpose depository institution for addressing any claims that are asserted after dissolution has been completed. The commissioner shall examine the application for compliance with this section, the business entity laws applicable to the required type of dissolution and applicable rules. The commissioner may conduct a special examination of the special purpose depository institution, consistent with W.S. 13-12-119(c), for purposes of evaluating the application.

      <li id="t13c12s13-12-123ol1c">
       If the commissioner finds that the application is incomplete, the commissioner shall return it for completion not later than sixty (60) days after it is filed. If the application is found to be complete by the commissioner, the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the application not later than thirty (30) days after it is filed. If the commissioner approves the application, the special purpose depository institution may proceed with the dissolution pursuant to the plan outlined in the application, subject to any further conditions the commissioner may prescribe. If the special purpose depository institution subsequently determines that the plan of dissolution needs to be amended to complete the dissolution, it shall file an amended plan with the commissioner and obtain approval to proceed under the amended plan. If the commissioner does not approve the application or amended plan, the special purpose depository institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.

       Upon completion of all actions required under the plan of dissolution and satisfaction of all conditions prescribed by the commissioner, the special purpose depository institution shall submit a written report of its actions to the commissioner. The report shall contain a certification made under oath that the report is true and correct. Following receipt of the report, the commissioner, no later than sixty (60) days after the filing of the report, shall examine the special purpose depository institution to determine whether the commissioner is satisfied that all required actions have been taken in accordance with the plan of dissolution and any conditions prescribed by the commissioner. If all requirements and conditions have been met, the commissioner shall, within thirty (30) days of the examination, notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that the dissolution has been completed and issue a certificate of dissolution.

       Upon receiving a certificate of dissolution, the special purpose depository institution shall surrender its charter to the commissioner. The special purpose depository institution shall then file articles of dissolution and other documents required by W.S. 17-16-1401 through 17-16-1440 for a corporation with the secretary of state. In the case of reorganization, the special purpose depository institution shall file the documents required by the secretary of state to finalize the reorganization.

The commissioner shall establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence that additional actions have been taken and the commissioner may extend any deadline upon good cause. If the special purpose depository institution fails to file a supplemental report showing that the additional actions have been taken before the deadline, or submits a report that is found not to be satisfactory by the commissioner, the commissioner shall notify the special purpose depository institution in writing that its voluntary dissolution is not approved, and the institution may appeal the decision to the board pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.
