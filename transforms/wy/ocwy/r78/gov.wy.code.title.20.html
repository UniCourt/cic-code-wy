       Various provisions of marriage statute constitute complete code on form and requisites

       Neither marriage statutes nor public policy would justify supreme court in holding that common-law marriages are valid and such “marriage” does not give to an alleged common-law widow share in the deceased's estate.

       This section requires that previous to the solemnization of a marriage a license for that purpose “must” be obtained. The mandatory requirement of a license is a legislative declaration of “public policy” which should be enforced by the courts and precludes the formation of the marriage tie in Wyoming by a common-law marriage.

       If any county clerk refuses to issue a license to marry, or in case of circumstances arising which would necessitate the waiver of any one (1) or more of the requirements of W.S. 20-1-102 and 20-1-103(b) and (c), either applicant for the license may apply to the district court of the county for the issuance of a license without compliance with one (1) or more of those requirements. If the judge finds that a license should be issued, or such circumstances exist that it is proper that any one (1) or more of the requirements should be waived, the judge may order in writing the issuance of the license. Upon the order of the judge being filed with the county clerk, the county clerk shall issue the license at the time specified in the order.

       In the absence of an agreement to the contrary the income, rents and profits of an estate by the entirety are an integral, indivisible part thereof and frequently are the most important part. The estate itself, title and fee thereof, is indivisible between husband and wife and cannot be alienated or in any way disposed of unless they agree to the contrary. That indivisibility must logically extend to every part of the estate including the rents, income and profits thereof and hence neither spouse would alone be able to divest the other thereof voluntarily or involuntarily against the wishes of the other during the life of both.

    Petition by spouse for support.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the husband and wife are living separately, or when they are living together but one (1) spouse does not support the other spouse or children within his means, and no proceeding for divorce is pending, the other spouse or the department of family services may institute a proceeding for support. No less than five (5) days after notice is personally served upon the nonsupporting spouse, the court may hear the petition and grant such order concerning the support of the spouse or children as it might grant were it based on a proceeding for divorce. If the nonsupporting spouse cannot be personally served within this state but has property within the jurisdiction of the court, or debts owing to him, the court may order such constructive service as appears sufficient and proper and may cause an attachment of the property. Upon completion of constructive service the court may grant relief as if personal service was had.

      </p>
      <p>
       To the extent that a district court dismissed a divorce action on the basis of improper statutory venue, the court erred because the husband filed the divorce complaint in the court in accordance with the applicable venue statute, as the husband lived in the county where the court was located and the wife did not live in Wyoming. Saunders v. Saunders, 2019 WY 82, 445 P.3d 991, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 84</cite> (Wyo. 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Postnuptial agreement's provision stipulating for divorce by simple termination of “contract” was void
   
   as against public policy, since dissolution of a marriage requires a decree of divorce by a court with appropriate jurisdiction. Combs v. Sherry-Combs, 865 P.2d 50, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 180</cite> (Wyo. 1993).

       The statutory grounds of divorce are exclusive,

      </p>
      <p>
       Court did not err in unequivocally granting a wife a divorce from the husband where neither party requested special findings, thus, the court was not required to state its findings concerning which party was aggrieved and why, the court signed and dated the divorce decree two days before both the default and the divorce decree were entered, and no authority required the court to postpone the divorce proceedings pending the clerk’s entry of default on the husband’s counterclaim. Commonwealth ex rel. Tinder v. Werner, 280 S.W.2d 214, 1955 Ky. LEXIS 152 (Ky. 1955).

       District court properly granted the wife attorney's fees and costs in a divorce case, where it was apparent from the record, including the accounting and itemized legal bills the wife submitted to the district court, as well as the wife's testimony, that the wife incurred the attorney's fees and costs at issue while attempting to enforce a district court's judgment against the husband; the statute authorized the district court to award the wife attorney's fees and costs for that purpose.

       While the statutes in divorce actions do not specifically provide authority to award attorney's fees, this section gives the trial court authority to require the husband to pay necessary sums for the wife to carry on or defend an action for divorce.

       Although husband and wife were both independently wealthy, this section does not require that wife establish financial necessity for an award of attorney's fees and costs, and her itemized list of expenses was sufficient to establish reasonableness of fees in light of expenditures made by husband.

       In post-divorce proceedings, the mother was the prevailing party on the father's motion to modify child custody; notwithstanding the parties'
   divorce settlement agreement, the district court's decision to award the mother $ 135,000 in attorneys'
   fees and costs under this section was not unreasonable. The mother proved the reasonableness of the fees under the lodestar test, because her motion contained minute detail as to all that was involved in incurring the fees and costs; during the motion hearing, counsel also argued as to the reasonableness of the attorneys'
   fees.

        The purpose of a divorce is to dissolve a marriage, and includes consideration by a judge of issues of child custody, child support, and alimony, while a tort action to recover compensation for emotional distress is normally decided by a jury; these types of actions are fundamentally different and the issues involved are completely unrelated, and consequently the requisite identical subject matter for the doctrine of res judicata to bar a subsequent action does not exist.

        District court acted reasonably in rejecting a mother’s request to award her specific assets to compensate for the refinancing funds the father spent on non-marital debts because it clearly articulated how the father’s refinancing impacted its equitable division of the marital property; the father generally used the refinance funds to pay down marital debt, and the district court did award the mother more assets and made her responsible for less debt.

       </p>
       <p>
        On several occasions the supreme court has announced these principles with respect to property divisions in divorce cases: (1) in making a division of property under the statute the trial court exercises a discretion; (2) there are no hard and fast rules to control its action; (3) the statute does not require an equal division; (4) a just and equitable division is as likely as not to be unequal; and (5) the decision of the trial court should not be disturbed, except on clear grounds, as that court is usually in a better position than the appellate court to judge of the respective merits and needs of the parties. Warren v. Warren, 361 P.2d 525, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 1961); Biggerstaff v. Biggerstaff, 443 P.2d 524, <cite class="wy_code">1968 Wyo.

        Where a husband was already retired at the time of divorce proceedings, to distribute the husband's retirement benefits and the parties'

        In a divorce matter, a trial court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the parties'

        Trial court had not abused its discretion in considering a purchase offer as evidence of the value of a marital home, even though that offer was not accepted by the parties and was not introduced as evidence at trial, and in valuing the home at the midpoint between the unaccepted offer and the husband's appraisal because that testimony was relevant and admissible as to value.

       <p>
        In speaking of future property, the supreme court is referring to a prospective expectancy of an estate which may come into being in the future as distinguished from future benefits to be derived from an estate already in existence.

       <p>
        With respect to future property, the rule must be that, when a court divides property incidental to the granting of a divorce, the court is limited by the amount of property in its hands for division and a mere expectancy is not subject to division.

The primary subject of a divorce action was the dissolution of the marriage, and the only proper parties to such an action were the spouses seeking to be divorced; as such, the wife's mother was not an appropriate party in the divorce action, and the district court erred as a matter of law by granting a judgment in her favor.

        Whether the district court erred by classifying the husband's employment benefits, including banked hours, vacation hours, and sick leave, as marital property was not properly presented to the district court as there was no evidence in the record about whether his employment benefits had cash value and the husband did not argue his employment benefits were not marital assets to the district court, and, thus, the Supreme Court of Wyoming declined to consider his argument.

        When a Wyoming court enters a divorce decree requiring a party to pay a fixed sum of money and does not set a date for payment different than the date the decree is rendered, the judgment interest statute applies and payment of interest is required; however, when a district court enters a decree and, in the exercise of its discretion to fashion a just and equitable property division, sets a date for payment different than the date the decree is rendered or provides for payment over time, it is not required to impose interest. Therefore, in a divorce case, a district court properly exercised its discretion when it suspended payment of interest as long as a husband made annual payments of at least $15,000 toward the property allocation.

        The district court had the jurisdiction and authority, under Rule 60(a), W.R.C.P., to modify a divorce decree, so as to provide that the parties were co-owners of certain property during their marriage, to reflect a prior oral pronouncement that any tax liability should be shared equally. As modified, the decree correctly reflected Wyoming law, which provides that even though property is owned separately by one spouse, as it was here, at the time the divorce complaint is filed the other spouse acquires a co-ownership interest in that property which is not defined until the entry of the decree which articulates the property settlement. Where the court finally grants co-ownership, which it did here, the co-ownership continues until the sale of the property, at which time each party is to pay his/her respective share of the federal income taxes arising, as though each party was a co-owner of the property during the marriage.

        It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to award the wife one of two cars owned by the couple, the home she owned prior to their marriage, the home acquired by the parties during their marriage, many of the home furnishings and payment of all of her outstanding medical bills.

        Trial court's award of the cattle operation to the father, while awarding the mother 15 percent of its value, resulted in the father receiving the majority of the parties' assets, but this was not an abuse of discretion given the relative short duration of the marriage, the fact that the father's family and community contacts contributed significantly to the operation’s growth, and the only debt the mother received was her student loan.

       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered the husband to pay alimony in a graduated amount for a ten-year term, notwithstanding that the husband was made responsible for all marital debt and that the trial court failed to provide a specific reason for the amount of time specified, where the husband's annual income was clearly disproportionate to the wife's unemployed status at the time of trial, and the wife had only intermittent and insubstantial work experience, no formal education beyond a GED, no special skills or qualifications, and undisputed medical constraints. Belless v. Belless, 2001 WY 41, 21 P.3d 749, <cite class="wy_code">2001 Wyo. LEXIS 51</cite> (Wyo. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's unequal property division and award of alimony to a wife was not an abuse of discretion because there was little to no way to adjust the division of real and personal property to accommodate potential income differences, the mother was the primary care giver for the parties' children, had no significant business experience or established employment, and the father had the ability to pay. Stevens v. Stevens, 2014 WY 23, 318 P.3d 802, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 24</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

       <p>
        Trial court's property division was not an abuse of discretion because an equitable split of assets and liabilities was made. Peak v. Peak, 2016 WY 109, 383 P.3d 1084, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 120</cite> (Wyo. 2016).

       District court,
   which required a father to pay 75% of his daughter's residential treatment
   costs, did not clearly err in rejecting the father's claim of an implied-in-fact
   modification of the parties' divorce agreement. The views reflected
   in the parties' testimony, coupled with the lack of any discussion
   between the parties as to cost sharing, made it objectively unreasonable
   to find an implied-in-fact agreement to modify the divorce agreement. Samiec v. Hopkins, 2015 WY 131, 358 P.3d 506, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 148</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       A provision in a divorce decree calling for payment of a sum certain — $800 a month for 10 years — and fixing the obligation as a lien upon real property in order to secure the payment even after the death of the parties was in fact a part of the property settlement and the trial court was without justification to change the payments.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in finding the father was voluntarily underemployed and in refusing to modify alimony as the district court was not bound to modify alimony because it modified the child support; the alimony served a different purpose and was not awarded solely on the basis of income but was, to a degree, in lieu of property available for division; and the court was justified in considering employment expectancy reasonably created by the father’s experience, capability and physical ability when it refused to modify the original award, notwithstanding the imputed income it used to modify child support.

       The grant of statutory power to provide for the custody and care of children in connection with a divorce decree does not abrogate the equitable powers of the court existing independent thereof.

       A modification proceeding involves new issues framed by facts differing from those existing when the original decree was entered. A new adjudication of the rights of the parties must be made.

       Provisions in a decree of divorce for payments for support of wife and children meant alimony, so that court may reduce allowance when changed circumstances demand. Lonabaugh v. Lonabaugh, 46 Wyo. 23, 22 P.2d 199, <cite class="wy_code">1933 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1933).

      </p>
      <p>
       Any modification of the judgment nisi by a court of this state must be consistent with previous decisions of the supreme court declaring that a modification hearing is not a time to reconsider the evidence and premises upon which the original judgment was entered, but only to consider whether there has been such change of circumstances as to warrant a different decree.

       Trial court did not abuse discretion in determining no substantial change in circumstances warranting modification or termination of husband's alimony obligation to his wife because husband failed to provide appellate court with an adequate record, including properly authenticated trial transcript or statement of the evidence pursuant to Wyo.

       An award of alimony to the husband in the amount of $120,000, to be paid in monthly installments of $1,000 over a period of 10 years, was vacated, where there was scant evidence of either the wife's ability to pay alimony or the husband's need for support.

       Where the separation agreement and the decree into which it was incorporated made no provision for automatic termination of alimony upon remarriage, the remedy available to the alimony obligor was reserved to a petition to modify the decree. Remarriage could be a change of circumstance, but it did not automatically cancel the obligation provided in the decree without amendatory court action. Swetich v.

       Considering the substantially equal division of the marriage property and the stated purpose of the payments provided for in the divorce decree — to support the wife due to her “lack of a college education, lack of employable skills, and medical condition” —, the trial judge did not err in his determination that these payments were indeed alimony, and in his deletion of language sounding in property settlement, i.e., “That should plaintiff die prior to said alimony being paid in full, plaintiff's estate, assignees and devisees shall be liable for the balance.” Yates v.

In contrast, the court found significant changes in the father's circumstances, including: regular employment for over 18 months, financial responsibility for himself and his children, and lifestyle changes which enhanced his ability to parent his children including the providing of health insurance for the children, his stoppage of smoking, drinking and chewing, and his remarriage.

       Court did not err in awarding custody of two children to mother during the school/work week (Sunday afternoon through Thursday) and to the father Thursday evening through Sunday. Evidence showed that the mother was a “stay at home mom” who maintained the home, helped with children with basic educational skills, and provided transportation, but father was a very engaged parent who worked a 40-plus hour work week but helped the mother with most of the child-rearing tasks.

       The court's determination that the children were “comfortable” in both homes did not sufficiently address the disruption which unavoidably results from moving the children's primary residence four times during the school year. Reavis v. Reavis, 955 P.2d 428, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo. LEXIS 35</cite> (Wyo. 1998), overruled in part, Bruegman v. Bruegman, 2018 WY 49, 417 P.3d 157, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred by failing to ensure that the children's best interests were protected when it ordered shared custody pursuant to a settlement agreement in a divorce proceeding without having all of the facts necessary to evaluate the impact that shared custody might have on the children.
   Eickbush v. Eickbush, 2007 WY 179, 171 P.3d 509, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 191</cite> (Wyo. 2007), overruled in part, Bruegman v. Bruegman, 2018 WY 49, 417 P.3d 157, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred by ordering shared custody where it did not serve the best interest of the child, as the arrangement would require the child to spend at least three hours every fourth day traveling on highways, sometimes in extreme winter weather conditions, would require him to attend two different day cares during the course of every week, and would separate him from his primary caregiver; district court's finding that both parties were “good parents” was insufficient to support the shared custody arrangement, as the parents did not live in close proximity, and they had no history of effective communication or cooperative decision making.
   Buttle v. Buttle, 2008 WY 135, 196 P.3d 174, <cite class="wy_code">2008 Wyo. LEXIS 138</cite> (Wyo. 2008), overruled in part, Bruegman v. Bruegman, 2018 WY 49, 417 P.3d 157, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court disregarded or failed to consider the factors in ordering shared custody, and the stated reasons were not a sufficient basis to order shared custody; the parties had significantly different philosophies regarding the developmental services the child would receive and shared custody did not provide the framework that best served the child. Williams v. Williams, 2016 WY 21, 368 P.3d 539, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 21</cite> (Wyo. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       In Wyoming, the fundamental consideration in determining child custody should be the best interests of the children. Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02a02s20-2-201ol1a" target="_self">20-2-201(a)</a></cite> (2017). The Supreme Court of Wyoming holds there is no presumption that shared custody is contrary to the best interests of the children and shared custody should be considered on an equal footing with other forms of custody. Bruegman v. Bruegman, 2018 WY 49, 417 P.3d 157, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court’s determination that shared custody was in the child’s best interests was affirmed where the district court considered the child’s developmental needs, and the record was replete with instances of the parties’ cooperating and sharing time with the child.

      <p>
       The definition of “rights of visitation” is an aspect of the determination of custody and, in custody matters, the welfare and needs of the children are to be given paramount consideration. The decision of the trial court with respect to such matters will not be disturbed by the supreme court unless it can identify a clear abuse of discretion. Rowan v. Rowan, 786 P.2d 886, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1990); KC v. KM (In re IC), 941 P.2d 46, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 96</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

       In an action to modify a divorce decree, the denial of visitation rights by either the custodial parent or the child does not constitute a change in circumstances justifying the reduction or termination of the noncustodial parent's support obligation. A child's need for support and a parent's ability to pay are not related to questions concerning visitation. Broyles v. Broyles, 711 P.2d 1119, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo.

       Under subsection (c), a grandparent has no standing to petition for visitation rights where his or her request for visitation rights is not premised upon “the death or remarriage of one (1) or both parents or after a divorce or judicial separation.” If grandparents are to have visitation rights in Wyoming, it is only after the occurrence of one of these precipitating events.

Moreover, the hearing concerning visitation was so abbreviated that the trial court could not reasonably have concluded that evidence had been presented of such a change warranting modification of visitation or that modification was in the best interest of the child; therefore, the father was prejudiced by the denial of the continuance.

       In a divorce action, a district court did not err in requiring a custodial parent to pay the travel expenses associated with two visits per year to the non-custodial parent's location because the travel costs were substantial and the custodial parent helped to create the situation by moving the parties' children to another state.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in requiring a father to pay his children's mother a per diem when she visited the children at their new out-of-state home because there was no immutable standard for the allocation of travel expenses for the purpose of visitation and the determination of the reasonableness of such an award was to be made on a case-by-case basis.

       Provision in divorce decree stating “the district courts of the state of Wyoming shall retain jurisdiction over the custody of the minor child” did not impose upon the father an affirmative obligation or duty to attempt custody modification only in a Wyoming court, nor did the provision impose an affirmative obligation or duty not to attempt to modify child custody in a state other than Wyoming; therefore the father could not be held in contempt for violating the order when he sought to have the custody decree modified in a Texas court.

       There is a serious danger that courts will be so ready to modify custody orders that the child will be disturbed and upset by repeated changes — the only cure being continued careful scrutiny of each case at the trial court level, coupled with the imposition of a heavy burden of persuasion upon the party asking for modification.

       Where it is contended that due to changed conditions a previous decree providing for custody of a child should be modified in the interest of the child so as to better provide for its welfare, the burden is upon the party alleging it, to prove that such change has in fact occurred, and that it warrants a modification. Laughton v. Laughton, 71 Wyo. 506, 259 P.2d 1093, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1953).

      <p>
       In determining whether or not there should be a modification of a divorce decree as to custody, it is the movant's burden to show there has been a change of circumstance and that, the welfare of the child being of first import, the change warrants a modification.

      </p>
      <p>
       The party seeking a modification of the custody provisions of a divorce decree bears the burden of showing that: (1) a substantial or material change in circumstances affecting the child's welfare has occurred subsequent to the entry of the initial decree; and (2) a modification of the decree will be in the child's best interests. Wilcox-Elliott v. Wilcox, 924 P.2d 419, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 147</cite> (Wyo. 1996), overruled, Clark v. Alexander, 953 P.2d 145, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo.

       Custody decree will not be modified unless there is a substantial change of circumstances

      </p>
      <p>
       In order to justify a substantial modification of decree awarding custody of a child, there must be a change of circumstances or the discovery of material facts unknown to the court at the time of the original decree. The paramount consideration is the welfare of the child. Laughton v. Laughton, 71 Wyo. 506, 259 P.2d 1093, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       While modification of a decree as concerns child custody rests in the sound judicial discretion of the trial court, a change will be made only for the most cogent reasons. Tanner v. Tanner, 482 P.2d 443, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 205</cite> (Wyo. 1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for a modification of a decree to be warranted, it must be established that there has been a material or substantial change in circumstances which outweighs society's interest in applying the doctrine of res judicata. Mentock v. Mentock, 638 P.2d 156, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 408</cite> (Wyo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the res judicata effect generally afforded divorce decrees, the party seeking to modify the child custody provisions of a divorce decree must show that there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the entry of the original decree warranting a modification of the child custody provisions. Ayling v. Ayling, 661 P.2d 1054, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 307</cite> (Wyo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court's determination that a child's desire to live with her mother did not constitute a material change in circumstances justifying modification of custody did not amount to an abuse of discretion or disclose any procedural error. Mulkey-Yelverton v. Blevins, 884 P.2d 41, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 136</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where parties' 2002 stipulation altered only visitation, not custody, the initial custody order, entered in 1998, was still in effect; therefore, the 1998 order was ‘the order in question’ under Wyo.

       It was error

       District court did not err in finding no substantial change of circumstances had occurred when children did not spend one-half of each year with their mother as provided in custody decree where it found parties had foreseen that provision in the decree would not be strictly adhered to because children would have to commute to school.

      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion by ruling that the changes of circumstances that occurred after the parties'
   divorce were not material and did not justify a change of custody because: (1) while the mother did, at times, fail to communicate with the father as required by the decree, significant evidence showed that she informed of many events affecting their sons, including illnesses and injuries, and discussed issues with the father, such as the older son's need for counseling and the younger son's behavioral problems; (2) the record did not establish that the mother repeatedly violated the visitation provisions of the decree, as the father testified that she had only interfered with his visitation rights one time in 2004; (3) at the time of trial, the younger son's behavioral problems had resolved and the older son's anxiety problems had also improved; (4) even though the mother moved frequently after the divorce, there was no evidence that she moved in order to undermine the relationship between the father and the children; and (5) the evidence established that, despite having experienced a great deal of instability in their lives since the divorce, at the time of trial the sons were healthy, well-behaved children who were generally doing well in school and living in a stable home with their mother, her fiance, and their new baby.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in denying the father's motion to modify the mother's visitation; the district court found that the mother's practice of dressing her son as a girl was being addressed in counseling, and implicitly the district court found that the child's welfare was being preserved, and while other judges might have found a material change of circumstances, the court could not retry the case on appeal, and no abuse of discretion was found.

       In a child
   custody dispute, there was no material change in circumstances to
   warrant a change in custody because a detective who investigated a
   report of abuse by a step-brother found that there was no evidence
   to support the allegation, and the step-brother no longer had any
   physical contact with the children. Thus, the evidence demonstrated
   that it was unlikely that the children were being abused by the step-brother
   and those allegations did not constitute a material change in circumstances.

       District court did not err by determining that a mother's relocation, nearly 1,400 miles from a father, created a material change in circumstances warranting the reopening of the original custody order; the considerable increase in the geographical distance created a material change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.

       When the reopening of a joint custody order is before the court, the stability-of-placement consideration that is central to the strict reopening standards in the primary custodial context appears to be of minimal importance because the joint custody order has not fixed one parent as the primary nurturer.

      </p>
      <p>
       A second distinctive feature suggests a joint custody order should be more readily opened. The premise of the joint custody order is the parents' ability to resolve between themselves the custodial details; when the parents are unable to make this cooperative arrangement work, a change of circumstances justifying judicial reexamination of the original joint custody order is demonstrated.

       In a child custody modification case where there was a split custody arrangement, the trial court erred in not finding that a material change in circumstances had occurred. The mother's relocation to another state could be viewed as such, so too that the mother's fiance and her brother were accused of sexually assaulting the parties' youngest daughter, and also the father's wife's abusive acts against her step-children could warrant a change. Thus the case was remanded for further proceedings. JRS v. GMS, 2004 WY 60, 90 P.3d 718, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 74</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

       Court did not err in modifying child custody where in addition to considering the mother's multiple relocations, it found that the mother had not maintained stable employment and had not provided adequate supervision of the children, she repeatedly interfered with the father's parental and visitation rights and failed to provide adequate treatment to the youngest daughter for her emotional problems until compelled to provide therapy by court order, and there was evidence that the mother had attempted to emotionally manipulate the children against their father.

       District court correctly concluded that the father established a material change in circumstances to reopen the visitation and that he was entitled to extended summer visitation and specific holiday visitation, but it abused its discretion by granting the father visitation for nearly the entire summer rather than the six weeks requested, as his proposed visitation schedule addressed problems that had arisen by requiring fewer exchanges and providing him with extended periods with the children.

       Father's unchanged circumstances, including having substandard housing and a probationary driver's license which limited his ability to pick up the children for visitation, outweighed the mother's relocation, which improved her employment prospects and increased stability for the children around her family, and supported the denial of the father's motion to modify custody.

        Mother properly found in contempt for visitation violations. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was properly held in civil contempt for violating a father's visitation rights because (1) court orders required certain conduct of the mother regarding that visitation, (2) the mother was aware of the orders, and (3) the mother disobeyed the orders without seeking modification.

      </p>
      <p>
       Mother was properly found in contempt of the divorce decree's provisions as the visitation and cooperation provisions were sufficiently clear and specific because, before the mother unilaterally discontinued the father's visits, she had allowed visitation supervised by parties other than the one listed in the decree, which was evidence that she understood the visitation terms; the mother was not allowed to unilaterally discontinue the father's visitation; and, although the decree did not specifically require telephone access, when the mother refused to allow the father telephonic or in-person visitation, she willfully interfered with the children's access to their father.

       Motion from which the mother appealed could be interpreted only as seeking temporary custody modification, given that it was not made pursuant to the statute, but plainly requested only an ex parte order granting emergency relief, and she did not serve the motion on the father or his counsel; because the order resolved only the issue of temporary custody, it was not appealable, and because the court lacked jurisdiction, the mother’s appeal was dismissed.

       In a custody case, because the district court found the mother to be in indirect contempt of court, without issuing a show cause order on the father’s motion, and that transgression of this statute was a serious procedural error that denied the mother her right to due process, the district court abused its discretion and its contempt holding against the mother was reversed.

      <p>
       District court did not deny the mother due process by forcing her into a second trial on the merits, without providing her notice that custody of the children was subject to modification, because the mother did not assert that the temporary order should have had conclusive effect under the principles of res judicata and she could not rely on the assertion now to impose retroactively the requirement that the father show a material change of circumstances to modify custody; although the request for setting failed to state with particularity the grounds for the motion, the mother had approximately eight months to file a motion for clarification; and the mother had a meaningful opportunity to prepare and to be heard.

        Material change in circumstances.—

      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there had been a material change in circumstances supporting the change of custody from the father to the mother; the father withheld visitation for seven months based upon his own determination that the mother’s boyfriend posed a threat to the child, despite the fact that the district court had found otherwise, and the father did not show that the district court erred in considering the child’s emotional state and/or need for counseling. Bishop v. Bishop, 2017 WY 130, 404 P.3d 1170, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 136</cite> (Wyo. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was an abuse of discretion to decline to reopen a custody and visitation order on a father’s motion because (1) the court’s apparent belief that the subject children had to show objective evidence of harm before the order could be reopened was error, and (2) the mother’s continued instability, poor decision-making regarding partners and the children’s care, and unwillingness to address issues affecting the children through counseling, which had been ordered, and the parties’ inability to make current custody and visitation arrangements work, demonstrated a material change in circumstances. Jacobson v. Kidd, 2018 WY 108, 426 P.3d 813, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 112</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wyoming Supreme Court has never said a district court must wait until children exhibit negative consequences before reconsidering custody and/or visitation, but the Court has said that, in order to be considered material, a change in circumstances must affect the children’s welfare, which means that the change holds some relevance in the children’s life, and a circumstance may have relevance in a child’s life before there are outward signs of harm, and a district court may take into account the obvious or natural effects of a situation in finding a material change in circumstance.

       District court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to change primary custody of the children because it considered the mother’s relocation and clearly had her motives for moving in mind when it made its decision; the district court discussed how the children fared under the original custody order, both before and after the mother’s relocation, and the children’s behavioral, social, and academic issues.

      <p>
       District court acted well within its statutory authority and discretion when it ordered temporary child support appropriate to circumstances during the proceedings, and then issued a permanent child support order, effective as of the last day of the trial; the retroactive child support order seemed particularly reasonable in this case where the final decree was necessarily delayed by father’s ill-fated, post-trial attempt to undermine mother’s fitness.

      <p>
       When the original divorce decree and subsequent modifications do not contain any references to child support, a later petition to establish support is not a “motion to modify,” although it may be improvidently so labeled. It is merely ancillary or supplemental to the main cause, and it is not necessary that a determination on the motion be based on a change in circumstance. The standard for establishing, rather than modifying, child support should apply. Warren v. Hart, 747 P.2d 511, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 566</cite> (Wyo. 1987).
      </p>

       Since provisions in original divorce decree pertaining to child support were void, subsequent proceedings were for purpose of establishment rather than modification of child support, and were thus not precluded by subdivision (a) of this section.

      <p>
       Social security disability payments awarded, post divorce, for the benefit of a father's disability, as a matter of law, do not constitute satisfaction of child support payments required by the divorce decree. The receipt of such benefits by the children is one factor to be considered by the court in making its determination as to whether a significant, material change of circumstances has occurred that is sufficient to justify modification of a noncustodial parent's obligation for support. The party obligated to make those payments has an affirmative duty to seek modification of the support order. Hinckley v. Hinckley, 812 P.2d 907, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo.

       The fact that children become entitled to receive social security benefits is not the exclusive factor for the court to consider in ruling upon a petition for modification. A determination of the amounts of child support that are appropriate in an instance in which modification is sought due to a change in circumstances requires a consideration of the needs of the children, the ability of the father to contribute to those needs and his responsibility to do so, and the ability of the mother to contribute to those needs and her responsibility to do so.

       District court properly excluded Massachusetts “CASH” benefits from mother’s income calculations because it qualified as means tested income; the phrase “such as” - akin to the term “includes” - is enlarging, not exclusive, and mother explained her income had to be below a certain amount to qualify for state benefits.

      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion when it included depreciation in a father’s income because the court’s calculations were supported by the record and did not exceed the bounds of reason. Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by adding certain distributions from a limited liability company established by the father and the father’s then wife to the father’s income.

      </p>
      <p>
       Child support award erred because the court found a father was voluntarily underemployed based on overtime income the father had earned more than 24 months prior to trial without finding the overtime income would continue. Johnson v. Johnson, 2020 WY 18, 458 P.3d 27, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Mother's motion
   to modify child support was properly denied because she was voluntarily
   unemployed from January to November 2013; she was able to earn the
   income imputed to her during this time period because she had active
   medical licenses in multiple states. She did not claim that her employment
   away from Wyoming prevented her from exercising visitation with the
   children, and her personality conflicts with colleagues that resulted
   in her leaving employment positions were not relevant as to whether
   she was able to find employment. Levene v. Levene, 2014 WY 161, 340 P.3d 270, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 184</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

        Calculation of husband’s net income. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In the parties' divorce, the trial court erred in determining the husband's net income because it was required to use the statutory definitions of “income” and “net income” rather than the arbitrary number associated with the amount he tithed to his church. Bagley v. Bagley, 2013 WY 126, 311 P.3d 141, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 131</cite> (Wyo. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Parties' income was properly calculated for purposes of child support modification because (1) it was not an abuse of discretion to deduct the mother's home office expenses, and (2) the court did not have to average the father's fluctuating income. Zupan v. Zupan, 2016 WY 78, 377 P.3d 770, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 86</cite> (Wyo. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court,
   which used the father's federal tax information to ascertain his income
   and added depreciation back to the adjusted gross income figure on
   the father's return, acted within its discretion in calculating the
   father's net income as it did for child support purposes; the district
   court correctly calculated the presumptive level of support by considering
   the parties' most recent income information as representative of their current earning ability, consistent with case law. Ackerman v. Ott, 2014 WY 93, 330 P.3d 271, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 103</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

        Relation to other statutes. —

      </p>
      <p>
       District court
   cannot simply sign off on a stipulated decree deviating from the
   guidelines
   when Title XIX Medicaid coverage benefits are being paid
   for the benefit
   of children; however, a court is not precluded from
   ordering a deviation
   downward from the presumed child support amount
   after making appropriate
   findings if a party has any of the means-tested
   sources of income
   referred to. District court may use its discretion
   and consider whether
   a deviation is appropriate, even when means
   tested sources of income
   are being paid on behalf of any of the children;
   this interpretation
   is consistent with other child support statutes. Dellit v. Tracy, 2015 WY 153, 362 P.3d 353, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 170</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

      <p>
       Monthly “contribution,” for use of first floor of father's house as a residence for the poor, was income for purposes of calculating father's child support obligation. Fountain v. Mitros, 968 P.2d 934, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo. LEXIS 168</cite> (Wyo. 1998), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. Jan. 5, 1999).

      <p>
       Where mother voluntarily left her teaching position and was a second-year law student with zero income, district court could reasonably find she was voluntarily unemployed, and could impute her income from prior years. KC v. KJM (In re IC), 971 P.2d 603, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 1999).

       <b>
        Uncertain historical gifts excluded from “income.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The court is afforded discretion to include or not include historical gifts as a source of income and may rule that gifts to a spouse were so uncertain as to preclude their inclusion in a calculation of monthly income. Triggs v. Triggs, 920 P.2d 653, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 102</cite> (Wyo. 1996), overruled, Vaughn v. State, 962 P.2d 149, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's award of child support was proper because it took into consideration the statutory factors, including decisions to impute income, how the fact that the children were still living in the mother's home impacted her ability to work, and that the father did not show that deviation was appropriate. Stevens v. Stevens, 2014 WY 23, 318 P.3d 802, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 24</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

        Deferred compensation is not “income.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount withheld from the father's pay for deferred compensation was not income under the child support guidelines, because deferred compensation is not a “payment or return in money or in kind” to the father when it is paid into a fund for his later benefit. Ahearn v. Ahearn, 993 P.2d 942, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 191</cite> (Wyo. 1999).

        Deduction of business expenses. —

      </p>
      <p>
       District court did not err in refusing to deduct defendant's purported business expenses in calculating child support; defendant relied almost exclusively on deductions appearing in his federal income tax return, which did not excuse him from responsibility of showing that deductions were reasonable and appropriate. Roseman v. Sackett, 979 P.2d 940, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 66</cite> (Wyo. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal portion of a business mortgage payment may be deductible if, in its discretion, the district court determines that the payment reasonably and legitimately reduces net income for child support purposes. Fleenor v. Fleenor, 992 P.2d 1065, <cite class="wy_code">1999 Wyo. LEXIS 184</cite> (Wyo. 1999).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court held if in computing child support, a trial court automatically rejected a business expense that had been afforded 26 USCS § 179 treatment, that court had not fulfilled its obligation under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02a03s20-2-303ol1aii" target="_self">20-2-303(a)(ii)</a></cite> to determine whether the amount should be deducted as a reasonable and legitimate business expense.

       It is clear from case law that the focus for determining income should be upon the reasonable and legitimate nature of the expense and its impact on the party's actual cash flow in the year in question rather than the treatment of the expense by federal law in the context of income taxes.

       Child support shall be expressed in a specific dollar amount. The following child support tables shall be used to determine the total child support obligation considering the combined income of both parents. The appropriate table is based upon the number of children for whom the parents share joint legal responsibility and for whom support is being sought. After the combined net income of both parents is determined it shall be used in the first column of the tables to find the appropriate line from which the total child support obligation of both parents can be computed from the third column. The child support obligation computed from the third column of the tables shall be divided between the parents in proportion to the net income of each. The noncustodial parent’s share of the joint child support obligation shall be paid to the custodial parent through the clerk as defined by W.S. 20-6-102(a)(x):

       When each parent keeps the children overnight for more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the year and both parents contribute substantially to the expenses of the children in addition to the payment of child support, a shared responsibility child support obligation shall be determined by multiplying the parents’ total child support obligation as derived from subsection (a) of this section by one hundred fifty percent (150%). After the shared responsibility child support obligation is determined, that amount shall be divided between the parents in proportion to the net income of each. The proportionate share of the total obligation of each parent shall then be multiplied by the percentage of time the children spend with the other parent to determine the theoretical support obligation owed to the other parent. The parent owing the greater amount of child support shall pay the difference between the two (2) amounts as the net child support obligation.

       When each parent has physical custody of at least one (1) of the children, a shared responsibility child support obligation for all of the children shall be determined by use of the tables. The shared responsibility child support amount shall be divided by the number of children to determine the presumptive support obligation for each child, which amount shall then be allocated to each parent based upon the number of those children in the physical custody of that parent. That sum shall be multiplied by the percentage that the other parent’s net income bears to the total net income of both parents. The obligations so determined shall then be offset, with the parent owing the larger amount paying the difference between the two (2) amounts to the other parent as a net child support obligation.

       If a proportion of a support obligor’s social security or veteran’s benefit is paid directly to the custodian of the obligor’s dependents who are the subject of the child support order, the total amount of the social security or veteran’s benefit, including the amounts paid to the obligor and custodian under the child support order, shall be counted as gross income to the obligor. However, in determining the support amount, the amount of the social security or veteran’s benefit sent directly to the custodian shall be subtracted from the obligor’s share of presumptive support. If the subtraction of the social security or veteran’s benefit sent directly to the custodian results in a negative dollar amount, the support amount shall be set at zero. The child support obligation shall be offset by the amount of the social security or veteran’s benefit sent directly to the custodian, beginning from the time the custodian began receiving the social security or veteran’s benefit. The obligor or the department of family services may apply to the court to receive a credit against arrears for any social security or veteran’s benefits that are paid retroactively to the custodian. For purposes of this subsection, “custodian” means the custodian of dependent children under a child support order and the physical custodian of dependent children who are the subject of a child support order.

       If the difference between the obligor’s net income and the self-support reserve is less than the support obligation as calculated from the tables in subsection (a) of this section, the support obligation shall be set using the difference between the obligor’s net income and the self-support reserve. As used in this subsection “self-support reserve” means the current poverty line for one (1) person as specified by the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal Register by the United States department of health and human services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2).

       Calculation of a father's child support obligation under this section was clearly incorrect as the net income figures specified represented a substantial decrease in the father's income and a substantial increase in the mother's income, yet the trial court increased the father's child support obligation; the trial court was ordered to arrive at a support calculation that complied with the statutory tables.

       District court, which used the father's federal tax information to ascertain his income and added depreciation back to the adjusted gross income figure on the father's return, acted within its discretion in calculating the father's net income as it did for child support purposes; the district court correctly calculated the presumptive level of support by considering the parties' most recent income information as representative of their current earning ability, consistent with case law.

      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to order a father to pay child support when the father had not filed a required financial affidavit because (1) the court had sufficient other evidence of the parties' finances, and (2) the father could not complain on appeal of the father's disregard of statutory requirements.

       District court properly denied a father’s motion for relief from an income withholding order because his motion requested that his child support obligation be vacated, he presented no argument that the order, itself, was improper or that Wyoming’s statutory approach to setting child support included an irrebuttable presumption, and did not present a record that would enable review of his claim, the court’s findings—which considered the needs of the children and the timing of the father’s release from prison—did not support an argument that the court applied an irrebuttable presumption, and it was arguable that the statute at issue created a rebuttable presumption of $50 per month minimum child support when read in conjunction with another section.

       In a child support modification suit brought on behalf of a child from the noncustodial parent's first marriage, the court was correct when it held that the children born to the petitioner's later marriage should not be factored into the child support guidelines matrix set forth in former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c06a03s20-6-304ol1a" target="_self">20-6-304(a)</a></cite> (now see <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c02a03s20-2-304" target="_self">20-2-304</a></cite>). However, the court erred when it concluded that it had to strictly apply the guidelines and could not take into consideration the parent's later-born minor children for purposes of determining the modification award, as the court may consider responsibility for later born children pursuant to subsection (b)(iv) of this section. Hasty v. Hasty, 828 P.2d 94, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 33</cite> (Wyo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court
   properly modified child support because it did not abuse its discretion
   in deviating from the presumptive child support amount; once the
   district
   determined that deviation was appropriate based on the
   father’s
   obligation to a later-born child from his subsequent
   marriage, nothing
   prevented it from calculating the appropriate
   support obligation
   by
   considering the presumptive amount for all
   of the father’s
   children.

       In a child support action, a district court erred by failing to modify child support in a proceeding commenced after a change from shared custody to primary custody with the mother. Pursuant to the presumptive child support guidelines, the father should have been required to pay 20 percent more than he had been required to pay under the previous order. McCulloh v.

       Defendant father's choice to reside in an economically depressed area where work in his former profession, at which he earned up to $50,000 a year, was not available, his decision not to exercise his right to overnight visitation with his daughter and therefore his not incurring meal and other additional expenses he would incur if she were staying at his home, one son's hearing disability, which required additional expenses for hearing aids and batteries, and the mother's provision of cash assistance to the oldest son in college, fell within the factors listed in this section which justified deviation from the presumptive child support level.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a child support case, a district court did not abuse its discretion by ordering a father to pay less than the statutory presumptive amount because he had necessary child day care costs, the father had the children for a substantial period of time, and he paid his share of uncovered medical expenses. However, the father did not have the children overnight for 40 percent of the time. Dellit v. Tracy, 2015 WY 153, 362 P.3d 353, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 170</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order directing a father to pay a mother $680 per month in child support was proper because the joint custody child support provision did not apply as the father's contribution was not substantial and he was, instead, entitled to a downward deviation under the statute from the presumptive child support amount for his additional contribution.

       Mother’s testimony was consistent with her confidential financial affidavit (CFA), which had sufficient required supporting documentation, and the district court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the CFA to calculate her monthly income; mother’s updated CFA listed her hourly rate at $ 13.50 and her weekly hours at approximately 27 hours, which was consistent with her testimony, and father’s bald assertion that her testimony reflected a much higher income was not supported by the record.

       Mother did attach multiple current pay stubs, her 2017 W-2, and her 2017 and 2018 tax returns to her confidential financial affidavit in satisfaction of the statute, and there was no offer of proof whereby the father could show that the mother’s 2018 W-2 would have changed the court’s calculations; there was no statutory violation or abuse of discretion that would require the district court’s calculation to be overturned.

       District court had sufficient evidence to arrive at a clear understanding of a father’s income without a hearing and did not abuse its discretion when it relied on the parties’ submissions to calculate the father’s income and child support. The district court had sufficient information to calculate the father’s income, and both the mother and the father presented memoranda and arguments regarding child support and attached financial affidavits, income tax returns, and other supporting documentation.

       Remand to a district court for additional proceedings to determine a father’s income was necessary because the district court abused its discretion under in ordering child support as the district court did not have sufficient information about the father’s finances to calculate child support, potentially misinterpreted the evidence before it, and ignored its statutory obligation to obtain that information before entering a child support order.

      <p>
       This section
   contains no timing requirements relating to the filing of a financial
   affidavit; therefore, a father did not prevail in his argument relating
   to a mother's financial affidavit because the mother filed a signed
   and notarized affidavit before a trial court entered its support order,
   and the father was not prejudiced in any manner by the delayed filing. Davidson v. Carrillo, 2014 WY 65, 325 P.3d 444, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 70</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion by using a mother's affidavit of indigency, which showed her gross income, because the mother disregarded its express order to provide a financial affidavit; the mother appeared at the default hearing, and the district court ordered her to submit a financial affidavit, which she did not do. Brush v. Davis, 2013 WY 161, 315 P.3d 648, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 168</cite> (Wyo. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not an abuse of discretion to order a father to pay child support when the father had not filed a required financial affidavit because (1) the court had sufficient other evidence of the parties' finances, and (2) the father could not complain on appeal of the father's disregard of statutory requirements. Peak v. Peak, 2016 WY 109, 383 P.3d 1084, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 120</cite> (Wyo. 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the district court was privy to information regarding the husband’s finances that would allow it to reach a decision about child support, and the husband’s failure to file a financial affidavit did not render the stipulated decree problematic with respect to child support, the fact that the district court did not acknowledge the presumptive child support amount did; further, the order originally establishing the amount of child support could not be relied upon as that order also failed to state the presumptive amount, and it did not give any indication as to how the court reached the $2,500 per month calculation.

       Motion to set aside the default divorce decree should have been granted under W.R.C.P. 60(b) because the trial court failed to base its findings of fact in accordance with W.R.C.P. 55(b)(2) regarding property distribution, child custody, visitation, and support on some evidence in the record, and the trial court did not comply with the dictates of Wyo.

      <p>
       District court erred by failing to recognize that a mother had a judgment against the father on child support arrears on the dates when they were due by operation of law with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State of Wyoming, including the ability to be enforced. Furthermore, the district court did not have authority to impede the mother's right to enforce the judgment. Rambo v. Rambo, 2017 WY 32, 391 P.3d 1108, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo.

       Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process did not require the State of Wyoming to provide an indigent party with counsel in a civil contempt proceeding for nonpayment of child support, because Wyoming had sufficient substitute procedural safeguards to protect indigent obligors against the possibility of wrongful incarceration. Respondent was informed of the burden on the State to show a failure to pay court ordered child support was willful; all respondents were provided forms upon which they could set forth current income, asset and liability information and were given opportunity to explain any reasons they may have for failure to pay; and the district court was also required make an express finding as to the obligor's ability to pay in order to determine whether the failure was willful or not under this section.

       Any party, or the department of family services in the case of child support orders being enforced by the department, may petition for a review and adjustment of any child support order that was entered more than six (6) months prior to the petition or which has not been adjusted within six (6) months from the date of filing of the petition for review and adjustment. The petition shall allege that, in applying the presumptive child support established by this article, the support amount will change by twenty percent (20%) or more per month from the amount of the existing order. The court shall require the parents to complete a verified financial statement on forms approved by the Wyoming supreme court, and shall apply the presumptive child support set out in this article in conducting the review and adjustment. If, upon applying the presumptive child support to the circumstances of the parents or child at the time of the review, the court finds that the support amount would change by twenty percent (20%) or more per month from the amount of the existing order, the court shall consider there to be a change of circumstances sufficient to justify the modification of the support order. The provisions of this section do not preclude a party or assignee from bringing an action for modification of a support order, based upon a substantial change of circumstances, at any time. Every three (3) years, upon the request of either parent or, if there is a current assignment of support rights in effect, upon the request of the department, the court, with respect to a support order being enforced under this article and taking into account the best interests of the child involved, shall review and, if appropriate, adjust the order in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to this article. Any adjustment under the three (3) year cycle shall be made without a requirement for a showing of a change in circumstances. The commencement of aid under the personal opportunities with employment responsibilities (POWER) program, medical benefits under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, supplemental nutrition assistance program and supplemental security income (SSI) shall be considered a substantial change of circumstances requiring modification of child support.

      <p>
       Father’s child support obligation was properly modified because, (1) while the mother alleged no material change in circumstances and the trial court did not so find, a material change occurred, as a custody change the mother alleged was more than enough to establish a change in circumstances, and (2) the court found a 20% increase in the presumptive support amount.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in finding no material change of circumstances justifying modification of child support where parent refused to pay support from severance pay or assets after termination of employment and had not attempted to find a job conforming to her physical restrictions, and the medical condition that she claimed was a change in circumstances existed at the time of the divorce.

      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give a father credit for an overpayment of his child support obligation, since
   statutes and case law indicated a clear aversion to the unilateral modification of child support orders, and the circumstances did not warrant application of the exception to the general rule because (1) the father overpaid the obligation intentionally and voluntarily, (2) the mother never asked the father for the extra payments, nor did his daughter, (3) the father unilaterally modified that obligation without court approval, and (4) it was the father's obligation to pay the specified amounts according to the decree, and orders modifying it thereafter.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in finding that no substantial change of circumstances occurred justifying reallocation of the dependent tax credit portion of the parties' divorce decree; even if the mother properly computed the amount of support she provided for the child, the income of the father, the noncustodial parent, remained higher than the mother's.

       A trial court's decision to modify a divorce decree is reviewed for abuse of discretion; an abuse of discretion occurs when a court's decision exceeds the bounds of reason or constitutes an error of law.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was no abuse of discretion in denying retroactive effect to a child support modification where the trial court's decision coincided with the oldest child's 18th birthday, when defendant father was no longer obligated to pay support for that son. Ready v. Ready, 2003 WY 121, 76 P.3d 836, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 147</cite> (Wyo. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the parties were sharing custody of the children, the father had been providing insurance for the children and paying half of their uncovered medical expenses and some of the mother’s expenses, and the court did not have sufficient financial information from the parties for the period of retroactivity, the district court’s decision not to award the mother retroactive child support was reasonable.

       Trial court properly granted a father's request to reduce his child support obligation when his eldest son turned 18-years-old and properly denied the mother's request to apply Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.14.html#t14c01a01s14-1-101" target="_blank">14-1-101</a></cite> as it existed when the parties were divorced in 1992, under which the age of majority was 19, and to extend the father's obligation until the children were 19-years-old where the original divorce decree and settlement agreement did not specify a child support obligation for either parent. Jordan v. Brackin, 2003 WY 151, 79 P.3d 536, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 180</cite> (Wyo. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err in ordering child support to end when the child became 18 and in having deviated from the presumptive support level; although the parties were not aware of their son's learning disability at the time that the divorce decree, that decree stated support would end once each child reached the age of 18, and the mother had forgiven the child support arrearages owed to her by the father.

       District court properly declined to determine what amount, if any, the father owed the mother for medical expenses, and thus, it did not abuse its discretion in declining to enter an order for a specific amount, because the amount, reasonableness, and necessity of the medical expenses for the child's care were not issues raised by the pleadings in the modification proceedings, and the district judge did no more than point out that expenses not covered by insurance were to be divided evenly under the existing decree.

     <p>
      No other or greater evidence is required to prove the marriage of a husband and wife or that the defendant is the father or mother of a child or children than is required to prove such facts in a civil action. In a prosecution under this act [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c03s20-3-101" target="_self">20-3-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t20c03s20-3-104" target="_self">20-3-104</a></cite>] no statute or rule of law prohibiting the disclosure of confidential communications between husband and wife shall apply. Both husband and wife are competent witnesses to testify against each other to any relevant matters including the fact of marriage and the parentage of the child or children but neither shall be compelled to give evidence incriminating himself or herself. Proof of the desertion of the wife, child or children in destitute or necessitous circumstances, or of the neglect or refusal to provide for the support and maintenance of the wife, child or children is prima facie evidence that the desertion, neglect or refusal is willful.

      Denial of visitation rights not change in circumstances. —

    </p>
    <p>
     The denial of visitation rights by either the custodial parent or the child does not constitute a change in circumstances justifying the reduction or termination of the noncustodial parent's support obligation. A child's need for support and a parent's ability to pay are not related to questions concerning visitation. Sharpe v. Sharpe, 902 P.2d 210, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 169</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

     Lack of visitation and negative feelings between a noncustodial parent and child are not proper factors that a court may consider in determining whether to deviate from the presumptive support guidelines; such consideration is, therefore, an abuse of discretion.

       Wyoming courts properly exercised jurisdiction in a child custody matter because Wyoming was the subject children's “home state,” as (1) there were no proceedings in another jurisdiction requiring a determination between competing alternatives, and (2) the parties returned to Wyoming slightly more than six months before the children's mother filed for divorce. Harignordoquy v. Barlow, 2013 WY 149, 313 P.3d 1265, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 156</cite> (Wyo. 2013), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 817, 135 S. Ct. 66, 190 L.

      <p>
       When child custody is awarded in a divorce decree in one state and the child-custody question is later presented to a court of another state, a number of considerations affect the determination as to whether the second state may exercise jurisdiction, including: domicile, presence in the state, lack of jurisdiction in the first state to render the original decree, forum shopping, child stealing, best interests of the child, full faith and credit, comity, child abuse, abandonment, etc. State ex rel.

      <p>
       Although it would be judicially efficient to approve the district court's actions in assuming jurisdiction over the father's motion to set aside and vacate portions of a divorce decree relating to child custody and support since the children had been in Wyoming longer than six months, such an action by the supreme court would undermine the legislative function, the purposes behind the former Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act jurisdictional requirements, and the basic doctrine of subject matter jurisdiction.

       Even in cases where Wyoming is the original decree state, when issue of concurrent jurisdiction is raised, court has duty to make a determination whether to exercise its discretion and retain jurisdiction over the matter or defer to courts of other state; court abuses its discretion if it retains jurisdiction solely on grounds that it issued original decree, since existence of jurisdiction is not determinative of whether that jurisdiction should be exercised under circumstances of a particular case.

      <p>
       Even in cases where Wyoming is the original decree state, when issue of concurrent jurisdiction is raised, court has duty to make a determination whether to exercise its discretion and retain jurisdiction over the matter or defer to courts of other state; court abuses its discretion if it retains jurisdiction solely on grounds that it issued original decree, since existence of jurisdiction is not determinative of whether that jurisdiction should be exercised under circumstances of a particular case.

       District court's order compelling the mother to deliver the children to Wyoming for visitation was a proper exercise of discretion under the district court's continuing jurisdiction as the decree court; the district court's order was appropriate to enforce visitation and, consequently, not some character of child custody decree modification.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was no abuse of discretion in a district court's determination that Wyoming remained an appropriate jurisdictional forum under this section where a father resided in Wyoming, children visited there, they had not been out of Wyoming long, and the parties were not separated by a very long distance. The father's consent to registering the judgment in Nebraska was not the same as consenting to Nebraska's jurisdiction, and there was nothing to show that the jurisdictional requirements under Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1240 were satisfied.

      <p>
       Motion to decline jurisdiction in a child custody case under this section was granted because the children had lived and attended school in Idaho for nearly two years, a new guardian ad litem was needed due to a withdrawal, and the district court in question was no longer convenient for a father due to his relocation.

      <p>
       Father's appeal
   of an order denying his objection to the district court's decision
   declining to exercise jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody
   Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act was dismissed because the father's
   failure to timely perfect an appeal from the order declining jurisdiction
   prevented him from invoking the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme
   court; the objection was nothing more than a motion for reconsideration
   and did not toll the time for filing an appeal. Waldron v. Waldron, 2015 WY 64, 349 P.3d 974, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 73</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       District court
   properly modified child support because it did not abuse its discretion
   in deviating from the presumptive child support amount; once the
   district
   determined that deviation was appropriate based on the
   father’s
   obligation to a later-born child from his subsequent
   marriage, nothing
   prevented it from calculating the appropriate
   support obligation
   by
   considering the presumptive amount for all
   of the father’s
   children.

When the parties agree to an alternative arrangement, the arrangement shall be in writing, signed by the parties and reviewed and entered in the record by the court. The court shall include in the record its findings of good cause, including a statement explaining why implementation of immediate income withholding would not be in the best interests of the child and, in cases involving modification of child support, proof of timely payments.

An income withholding order under this subsection shall be entered without a hearing if an arrearage occurs.

       This section is not an unconstitutional infringement on the fundamental right of a parent to rear his or her children without undue governmental interference, since the state has a compelling state interest in protecting the best interests of children and in maintaining the right of association of grandparents and grandchildren.

       Petition to set aside the modification of a custody order granting custody to a father was dismissed because a stepfather and a sibling have no standing to pursue such an action by way of statutes or common law due to the fundamental right to care and control held by the parents. The only persons allowed to pursue such an action are grandparents and primary caregivers. MBB v. ERW, 2004 WY 134, 100 P.3d 415, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 175</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

        Mother lacked standing to assert grandfather's right to visitation. —

      <p>
       Although the child's mother might be concerned about preserving a relationship between the child and her family, she did not have a personal interest in the grandfather's petition for visitation under this section. The mother, therefore, did not have standing to claim that the district court erred by failing to grant the grandfather visitation with the child or to argue that the grandfather's right to familial association was deprived by the district court's order.

        Visitation rights after adoption. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature did not provide that paternal grandparent visitation rights survived the adoption of their grandchild by the child's maternal grandparents, such visitation rights were limited and terminable without notice, and therefore did not rise to the magnitude of constitutionally protected liberty interests. The adoption statutes extinguished all legal relationships between the adopted child and his biological family. Hede v. Gilstrap, 2005 WY 24, 107 P.3d 158, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo.

       With notice or reasonable efforts to provide notice to the noncustodial parent, a person may bring an original action against any person having custody of the child to establish reasonable visitation rights to the child if the person bringing the original action has been the primary caregiver for the child for a period of not less than six (6) months within the previous eighteen (18) months. If the court finds, after a hearing, that visitation would be in the best interest of the child and that the rights of the child’s parents are not substantially impaired, the court shall grant reasonable visitation rights to the primary caregiver. In any action under this section for which the court appoints a guardian ad litem, the person bringing the original action under this section shall be responsible for all fees and expenses associated with the appointment.
