       Laws 2005, ch. 125, § 1, directs the state health officer and the department of health in collaboration with the Wyoming department of agriculture and the Wyoming department of environmental quality to convene a multi-disciplinary task force to conduct a study of environmental health issues currently identified, the state and federal agencies to whom those issues are currently assigned and those environmental health threats identified but not clearly assigned to a particular state agency. The study is to examine overlapping governmental jurisdiction and jurisdictional gaps in environmental health matters and, to the extent needed, recommend solutions to these problems. The department is to produce and submit a comprehensive plan to coordinate and clarify agency responsibility for environmental health issues, together with recommendations for any initial legislation, to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee by November 15, 2005. The act appropriates $50,000 from the general fund to the department of health to implement the purposes of this act and further provides that the department of health may use existing resources and apply for any federal or private grants that may be available to augment funding for the required study and plan.

    <p>
     A dusting pilot engaged in the weed and pest control business,
   who was denied a spraying contract by a private, nonprofit corporation
   despite being the lowest resident bidder, did not establish his federal
   civil rights claim. The private corporation's receipt of substantial
   amount of public funding from a county weed and pest control district,
   a public corporation, did not convert its status to that of a public
   corporation. Thus, the pilot had no more than a unilateral expectation
   of a statutory preference right (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.16.html#t16c06a01s16-6-102" target="_blank">16-6-102</a></cite>), and not a legitimate claim of entitlement, i.e., property

      <p>
       There is no subsection (b) in this section as it appears in the printed acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivisions (a)(ix)(B)(II) and (x)(B)(I) and (II) of this section
   were amended and subsection (b) was added by 2007 Wyoming Session
   Laws, Chapter 168, which provided the act was effective on and after
   July 1, 2007 only upon certification by the Governor to the Secretary
   of State of the occurrence of specified acts. On February 27, 2008,
   in accordance with
   W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.23.html#t23c01a01s23-1-109ol1f" target="_blank">23-1-109(f)</a></cite>, the Governor filed with the Secretary of State his certification
   that all acts necessary for 2007 House Enrolled Act 123 (2007 Wyoming
   Session Laws, Chapter 168) to become effective have occurred. On November
   19, 2007 the Governor certified that in accordance with subsection
   (b) of this section the trophy game management boundary line for the
   gray wolf has been changed and that the new boundary line is set forth
   on pages 4 and 5 of the Wyoming Gray Wolf Management Plan (November,
   2007). Subsequent to the certifications by the Governor, actions by
   the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and federal district court rulings
   have vacated the publication upon which the initial certification
   was based. The statute has been published in accordance with the Governor's
   certifications.

      After the hearing, if
   the commission determines, upon the facts presented at the hearing
   and other relevant facts that are available, that there is need in
   the interest of the public health, safety and welfare for a conservation
   district to function in the territory considered at the hearing, it
   shall record such determination and define by metes and bounds or
   by legal subdivisions the boundaries of the district. In making the
   determination and defining the boundaries, the commission shall give
   weight and consideration to the topography of the area considered
   and of the state, the composition of soils therein, the distribution
   of erosion, the carrying capacity and condition of grazing lands,
   the numbers of livestock grazed, the prevailing land use and management
   practices, the desirability and necessity of including within the
   district the particular lands under consideration and the benefits
   such land may receive from being included within the district, the
   relation of the proposed district to existing watersheds and agricultural
   regions and to other conservation districts already organized or proposed
   for organization, and such other physical, geographical and economic
   factors as are relevant, having due regard to the legislative policy
   set forth in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t11c16s11-16-103" target="_self">11-16-103</a></cite>. The territory included within the district need not
   be contiguous. If the commission determines there is no need for a
   conservation district to function in the territory considered at the
   hearing, it shall record such determination and deny the petition.
   Any owner of lands within a proposed district which is less than a
   countywide district may have his owned and leased lands excluded from
   the proposed district upon presentation of a petition and description
   of the lands to the commission not less than seven (7) days prior
   to the holding of the referendum for the organization of the district.

If a majority  of the votes cast favor dissolution of the district it shall certify  that fact to the supervisors of the district.

The application  shall recite that the property of the district has been disposed of  and the proceeds paid over as provided by law, setting forth a full  accounting of the properties and proceeds of sale.

This statement  is a warning only to the distributor or registrant that if the animal  remedy is distributed further the director may pursue further action.  If the distributor, registrant or manufacturer heeds the warning and  corrects the violation within the time allowed by the director, no  further action shall be taken.

In no instance  shall the disposition of the animal remedy be ordered by the court  without first giving the manufacturer, distributor or registrant an  opportunity to apply to the court for release of the animal remedy  or for permission to process or relabel the animal remedy to bring  it into compliance with the law.

       The board may issue an in-state range  movement permit for the movement of livestock from a location in Wyoming  to a noncontiguous location in another county provided the applicant  and the ranch meet the requirements of this subsection and criteria  established by rules of the board. The movement shall be for the purpose  of pasturing, grazing, feeding the livestock, veterinary care, commercial  lease or use or other board approved movement that is considered necessary  for normal ranch management operating conditions. The movement shall  not be for the purpose of changing ownership. A permit under this  section may be issued only to bona fide owners or Wyoming resident  lessees of qualified ranch lands headquartered within Wyoming or their  authorized employees. As used in this section, a qualified ranch means  a ranch that has been used for a period of time or purpose specified  by the board and which use can be verified by brand inspection records.  A permit may be denied by the board after a finding that the person  applying for a permit has violated a brand inspection or animal health law, including a provision  of this section, a board brand inspection or animal health rule or regulation or a board order.

The movement shall be for the purpose of pasturing,  grazing, ranging or feeding the livestock or other board approved  movement that is considered necessary for normal ranch management  operating conditions. The movement shall not be for the purpose of  changing ownership. A permit under this section may be issued only  to bona fide owners or Wyoming resident lessees of ranch lands headquartered  within Wyoming or their authorized employees.

       Genuine issues of material fact existed where car's passenger was killed as result of collision of car with cattle on paved portion of road; jury should determine what type of precautions ranchers, as reasonable persons under all the circumstances, should have taken to keep their cattle off roadway, and jury must be body to determine from conflicting evidence what precautions were actually taken by the ranchers, and whether cattle were drifting from their summer pastures since the record suggested the ranchers may have been using fenced roadway as a catchpen or corral for their cattle.

       Summary judgment was improperly granted in a negligence case arising from a motor vehicle accident involving a cow roaming on a highway, because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this section was violated when the cow escaped from a fence that was either damaged or unsecured. There was a conflict in the testimony regarding the cause of the opening in the fence holding the cow.

       A statute making it unlawful for an owner of livestock “to permit” them to run at large implies knowledge, consent and willfulness on the part of the owner or such negligent conduct as is equivalent thereto, so that the proof of one of these elements is essential either to a conviction or an assessment of damages growing out of a violation.

    </p>
    <p>
     “(c) Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this section a skill based amusement game that meets the requirements of this section shall be approved by the commission to continue operating in the state or it shall be removed from the state by the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(d) Each operator shall provide for a nationally recognized, independent gaming laboratory approved by the commission to directly submit to the commission a general functional evaluation laboratory report regarding the software installed on each skill based amusement game indicating whether the skill based amusement game is in compliance with this section. Any skill based amusement game that does not meet the requirements of this section as indicated by the laboratory report shall immediately be removed from the state by the operator.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(e) Skill based amusement games that meet the requirements of this section shall bear a commission issued decal that identifies the operator of the game. No skill based amusement game shall be operational unless it bears a commission issued decal. The commission shall charge a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for a decal. Each decal shall include the bucking horse and rider emblem. Fees collected shall be deposited to the commission gaming account, which is hereby created. For the period from the effective date of this section through June 30, 2021, funds within the account are continuously appropriated to the commission to pay for reasonable expenses incurred to administer this section.

An establishment shall conspicuously mark each area of the establishment with a skill based amusement game as an ‘age restricted area.’ The establishment shall not allow a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years to play a skill based amusement game.
    </p>
    <p>

The commission shall deposit these monies to the commission gaming account. The commission shall report on amounts received under this subsection to the joint appropriations committee quarterly.

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
     “(ii) Forty-five percent (45%) to the school foundation program account;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iii) Ten percent (10%) to the commission gaming account.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(n) The commission may promulgate any necessary rules to implement and administer this section.

      <p>
       Bearing in mind that Wyoming has always been an open-range state in the sense that the owner of cattle or horses is not required to confine them or to prevent them from straying or wandering upon the unenclosed premises of another, it is clear that the object of this section was merely to prescribe such a fence as would enable landowners to enforce certain remedies against the owners of trespassing animals and not to prohibit other kinds of fences.

   under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t11c28s11-28-106" target="_self">11-28-106</a></cite> for the period beginning when the fence became lawful. Thus, neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel would prevent an owner of a fence from attempting to prove the fence became legal after a first suit under subsection (b) of this section was dismissed, because it was “as effective for resisting breaching stock as those described in subsection (a).” Osborn v.

       It is not the duty of a landowner to fence against cattle of another unless such duty has arisen by prescription or is specifically declared by contract or by law. Garretson v. Avery, 26 Wyo. 53, 176 P. 433, <cite class="wy_code">1918 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 1918).

       If unlawful fence becomes lawful, individual maintaining fence may be entitled to reimbursement
   
   under this section for the period beginning when the fence became lawful. Thus, neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel would prevent an owner of a fence from attempting to prove the fence became legal after a first suit under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t11c28s11-28-102ol1b" target="_self">11-28-102(b)</a></cite> was dismissed, because it was “as effective for resisting breaching stock as those described in subsection (a).” Osborn v.

       Any person owning or having in his possession  or charge any livestock or domesticated buffalo which breaches into  any lawful enclosure belonging to someone other than the owner of  the animal, is liable to the party sustaining the injury for all damages  sustained by reason of such breaching. Damages may be recovered in  a civil action before any court having jurisdiction, or by arbitration,  each party to select a property holder and the two (2) arbitrators  to select a third. The arbitrators shall be sworn before a judge of  a circuit court before entering upon their duties. The arbitrators  shall carefully examine the fence and assess the damage done, examine  witnesses under oath, one (1) of them to administer the oath to the  witnesses, and make a written report signed by at least two (2) of  the arbitrators, to the circuit court in the county in which the damage  is sustained. The finding of the arbitration, as provided for in this  section, shall within three (3) days after rendered, be filed with  a judge of a circuit court in the county where the trespass was committed,  who shall enter the cost upon his docket and proceed to issue execution  therein as in other cases originally commenced before him.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c28s11-28-108ol1b">
       The party sustaining the damage shall  notify the owner or person having in charge the offending animals,  of the damage and the probable amount if he knows to whom the animals  belong and if the owner or keeper resides within the county where  the damage was committed.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c28s11-28-108ol1c">
       The person suffering damage may restrain  and keep in custody as many of the offending animals as are equal  in value to the damage done, until the finding of the court or arbitration  is ascertained, unless before suit the amount of his claim and expense  of keeping the animals is tendered to him.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c28s11-28-108ol1d">
       If, upon trial of any action under subsection  (a) of this section, it appears the plaintiff’s enclosure is a lawful  fence, he shall be allowed to prove the amount of damage sustained  and if he has retained in custody the animals committing the damage,  the amount of expense incurred for keeping the animals. Any judgment  rendered for damages, costs and expenses against the defendant shall  be a lien upon the animals committing the damage. If it appears upon  trial that the plaintiff’s enclosure is not a lawful fence or that  no damage was sustained, judgment shall be rendered against the plaintiff  for costs of suit and damages sustained by defendant.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c28s11-28-108ol1e">
       If upon trial it appears the defendant  is not the owner or person in charge of the offending animals, he  shall be discharged from the action with his costs, and the suit may  proceed against a defendant whose name is unknown. If, at the commencement  of the action, the plaintiff does not know the name of the owner or  keeper of the offending animals, he may bring suit against a defendant  unknown.

       Any person with authority to enforce this chapter who has probable cause to believe there has been a violation of this chapter may, in consultation with an agent or officer of the board, impound any livestock animal treated cruelly as determined by a Wyoming licensed veterinarian or veterinarian employed by the board.

         Within the earlier of seventy-two (72) hours of impoundment or charges being filed, the circuit court shall hold a hearing to set a bond in an amount the circuit court determines is sufficient to provide for the livestock animal's reasonable costs of impoundment for at least ninety (90) days including the day on which the livestock animal was impounded. At the request of the owner of the livestock animal, the court may make a determination on the disposition of the livestock animal at a hearing pursuant to this paragraph;

        <li id="t11c29s11-29-114.1.ol1bii">

The owner of the livestock animal shall be liable for all costs associated with the final disposition of the livestock animal under this subsection. Posting of a bond shall not prevent the person with authority to enforce this chapter from disposing of the impounded livestock animal before the expiration of the period covered by the bond if during a disposition hearing pursuant to subsection (g) of this section the court orders the forfeiture of the livestock animal to a person with authority to enforce this chapter or the owner voluntarily forfeits the livestock animal. No animal shall be forfeited without a hearing pursuant to subsections (g) through (j) of this section, regardless of whether a bond is posted, if the animal is connected to the livelihood or ability to make a living of the owner.

If, after the hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the livestock animal was not subjected to a violation of this chapter, the livestock animal shall be returned to the owner of the livestock animal and the owner shall not be responsible for any reasonable costs of the impoundment incurred after a finding that the livestock animal was not subjected to a violation of this chapter unless the person later pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of this chapter.
