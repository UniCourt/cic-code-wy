     <p>
      The legislature finds that a shortage of primary care physicians and allied health providers exists in the state of Wyoming which limits the availability of adequate health care services for the citizens of the state who live in rural areas. The legislature further finds that the number of qualified physicians and allied health care providers can be increased to enhance the provision of rural health care services by the adoption of incentives to attract more primary care physicians and allied health care providers to communities experiencing these shortages. The legislature therefore enacts the Rural Health Care Act of 1993 to create an office of rural health care and to create a loan repayment program to repay education loans of primary care physicians and allied health care providers who practice for specified periods of time in designated communities which are experiencing shortages.

      Laws 2004, ch. 95, § 310, effective July 1, 2004, appropriates $20,000 from the general fund to the legislative service office to fund the preparation of two annual prescription drug cost containment reports. The department of health and legislative service office research staff are each to prepare a cost/benefit report on the savings realized and direct and indirect costs incurred in the implementation of any prescription drug cost-containment measure including but not limited to a preferred drug list, prior authorization, refill too soon program, lock-in program for narcotics, state maximum allowable cost program, or quantity limitations. The report will assess all therapeutic prescription drug classes that are currently subject to prior authorization and incorporate all prescription drug programs administered by the state. Costs and savings should include consideration of the following: (1) direct costs such as staffing, contracts and other resources used; (2) cost shifting to physicians in terms of added time spent in obtaining authorization for a selected course of therapy; (3) internal program cost shifting, including but not limited to additional prescriptions, laboratory tests, physician visits, hospitalization, and skilled nursing care that are associated with the implementation of the prior authorization program; (4) discussion of qualitative costs and benefits experienced by patients; and (5) direct state and federal prescription drug expenditure savings. The legislative service office and the department of health shall collectively agree upon the necessary data to be collected but the department of health will be solely responsible for all data collection as well as any related expenditures for data collection and preparation of the department's annual report. The legislative service office and the department of health will include recommendations for improvement of this evaluation process as a part of each annual report. The department of health and the legislative service office shall separately report their annual findings of this study to the joint appropriations interim committee and the joint labor, health and social services interim committee by December 1, 2004 and October 31, 2005.

       The governor shall periodically review agency budgets and expenditures. If the governor determines during the review that the probable receipts from taxes or other sources of revenue for any fund or account will be less than were anticipated, and if the governor determines that these receipts plus existing revenues in the fund or account which are available will be less than the amount appropriated, the governor, after complying with the provisions of this section, shall give notice to the state agencies concerned and reduce the amount expended to prevent a deficit. In making any determination under this subsection the governor may but need not consider statutory authority to transfer appropriated funds or use a contingent appropriation to address revenue shortfalls. This subsection shall apply to all appropriations to state agencies regardless of whether the appropriation is for a specified project or purpose, including but not limited to capital construction projects.

      Former Article 15 was unconstitutional because it violated equal protection clause of state constitution.

     It was not rationally related to protection of the public health or economic and social stability of the state.

      District court did not err in dismissing plaintiff's Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.S. §§ 1346, 2671-2680, claims for failure to comply with the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act of 2005, Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§

      ; complying with the Wyoming Act did not constitute an unnecessary repetition of the FTCA's requirements (rather, compliance furthered Wyoming's goal of preventing where possible the filing in court of actions against health care providers and their employees for professional liability in situations where the facts do not permit at least a reasonable inference of malpractice), and a claimant's compliance with the Wyoming Act's requirements was mandatory, even if a health care provider ultimately chose not to participate in the process (because a claimant's obligations were not excused when a private provider declines to participate, they likewise could not be excused merely because the United States would not participate).

      Wyoming Governmental
      Claims Act's (WGCA) omission of a reference to the tolling provision
      contained in the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act of 2005 evidences
      the legislature's intent that the tolling provision does not apply
      in the context of the notice-of-claim requirement under the WGCA;
      accordingly, the tolling provision in the Medical Review Panel Act
      does not operate to toll the two-year period for submitting a notice
      of claim to a governmental entity under the WGCA. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121,

      District court
      did not err in dismissing a personal representative's complaint against
      a medical center because the representative failed to submit a timely
      notice of claim under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act (WGCA);
      the tolling provision contained in the Wyoming Medical Review Panel
      Act does not operate to toll the two-year period for submitting a
      notice of claim to a governmental entity under the WGCA. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121,

     <p>
      Because a
      personal representative's notice of claim to the Medical Review Panel
      was filed over two years after the date of the alleged act, error,
      or omission, the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act of 2005 could not
      have operated to toll the time period for filing a notice of claim
      under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121,

      Plain language
      of the statute unambiguously indicates the tolling period applies
      to the filing of a “complaint” in any court against
      a health care provider, but a notice of claim is not a “complaint”
      that must be filed in a “court”; it must be submitted
      to the governmental entity alleged to have been responsible for causing
      harm to the claimant, and if the condition is satisfied, the claimant
      is subject to a one-year statute of limitations for filing an action. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121,

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this act is to establish a framework whereby the executive branch of state government can be reorganized into a limited number of departments to ensure state resources are effectively and efficiently applied to implement programs and policy established in accordance with law thereby better serving the citizens of Wyoming. This act serves as the basic reorganization act, but each new department of state government as reorganized shall be created by a separate act. These separate acts creating a department establish a procedure under which detailed plans for organization of the department can be developed and submitted for review by the public and final approval by the legislature.

     <p>
      “(a) The department of family services shall develop a comprehensive plan to improve the lives and futures of all children and families in Wyoming.

     <p>
      “(i) Consider development of mechanisms to employ the use of public and private resources in an efficient manner to meet the needs of children and families;
     </p>

     <p>
      “(ii) For addressing gaps or deficiencies in services;
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      “(iv) For the consolidation of programs or funding sources where appropriate;
     </p>
     <p>
      “(v) For the development of comprehensive, integrated state and community level approaches that will leave no child unsupported in critical aspects of life, particularly from birth through five (5) years of age;

      “(c) The department shall widely disseminate requests, including through electronic media, for the active participation of private groups and organizations in the development of the plans. Before submitting the preliminary and final plans to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee, the department shall issue drafts of the plans for public review and hold at least one (1) public meeting in a central location in the state to receive public comments on each plan.
     </p>

      The fact that the low bidder could establish itself as qualified to do the work on a state project in the judgment of the trial court on the basis of post-award court proceedings was immaterial, given its lack of response or noncompliance with the prescribed requirements of the proposal forms. Bids for public contracts must substantially comply with the requirements of the specifications for bidding and the directions to prospective bidders.

Pursuant to rules adopted by the administrator of the personnel division, the parties to a personnel appeal shall submit the name of a presiding officer as mutually agreed to. If the parties fail to submit a name within the time allowed, or if that person is, at any time, unable or unwilling to serve, the administrator shall immediately refer the matter to the office of administrative hearings. A hearing officer from the office of administrative hearings may be peremptorily disqualified from acting in a case by the filing of a motion by either party within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of the assignment of that hearing officer.

       Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

     <p>
      This section, on its face, created an age-based distinction in terms of employment for purposes of the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. Accordingly, because direct evidence of discriminatory motive existed, the state's mere articulation of a legitimate reason for an employee's forced retirement was not enough, and it had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would have been terminated even absent this section's mandatory retirement provisions. EEOC v. Wyoming Retirement Sys., 771 F.2d 1425, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22845 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where a 65-year old government employee did not seek an extension under subsection (b) and was, accordingly, “retired,” he was “involuntarily retired and injured” for purposes of the federal EEOC v. Wyoming Retirement Sys., 771 F.2d 1425, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22845 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      In an action under the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the defendants — the state, the Wyoming retirement system and the governor — relied in good faith upon the attorney general's advice that subsection (b) met the requirements of the ADEA. They did not, therefore, commit a willful violation and were not liable for liquidated damages. EEOC v. Wyoming Retirement Sys., 771 F.2d 1425, 1985 U.S. App. LEXIS 22845 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1985).

      Laws 2002, Sp. Sess., ch. 82, § 5 states that it is the intention of the legislature because the benefits of the law enforcement pension account are mandated by state law, that the state of Wyoming fund the unfunded accrued liability of the account. The unfunded liability is to be amortized over a twenty (20) year period with annual payments by the state to be in an actuarially determined amount.

While the funded ratio has increased, reliance on the improvement as an indication of this plan’s financial health would be misplaced as the legislation establishing the plan provided a general fund appropriation of nine hundred seventy-eight thousand two hundred dollars ($978,200.00) to fund the difference between the actuarially determined premium for participation in the plan and the contributions required by law. The contributions required by law are insufficient to support the stated benefits under the plan and no long term external funding source was provided when the plan was established, nor thereafter.

         All of the funded ratios specified in paragraph (ii) of this subsection, except for the paid firemen’s plan A, were calculated with the assumptions of no benefit increases or additional cost-of-living adjustment increases;

        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1aiv">
         Actuarial funded ratios at any single point in time disclose only a portion of the soundness of the retirement plans. Underlying the ratios is an assumed eight percent (8%) investment return (composed of a three and one-half percent (3.5%) inflation rate and a four and one-half percent (4.5%) net real rate of return) on each of the various funds. The average market value returns for the largest plan under the board’s administration has been three and sixty-three hundredths percent (3.63%) for the last five (5) years and four and twenty-three hundredths percent (4.23%) for the last ten (10) years, both well below the assumed eight percent (8%). The retirement system’s actuary has stated: “Even seemingly minor changes in the assumptions can materially change the liabilities, calculated contribution rates and funding periods.” Investment returns of less than one-half (1/2) of the assumed rate is a major deviation from assumptions;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1av">
         Where the current actuarial value of assets is higher than the market value of assets, continued recovery in the investment markets will be needed over the next few years, annual returns in excess of the assumed investment return of eight percent (8.0%), to keep the plans’ funded ratios and unfunded actuarial accrued liability relatively stable in the short term;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1avi">
         While investments in markets have been authorized by constitutional amendment for retirement funds and supported by legislative authorization, if annual realized returns are lower than assumed or higher than assumed, the funded ratios are respectively overstated or understated;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1avii">
         The public employee plan administered under W.S. 9-3-401 through 9-3-430 has by far the largest membership as it contains eighty-eight and six-tenths percent (88.6%) of the membership of all public employee retirement plans administered by the Wyoming retirement board. The actuarial funded ratio for this plan has dropped from one hundred thirteen and seventy-seven hundredths percent (113.77%) in 2001 to eighty-four and fifty-nine hundredths percent (84.59%) in 2011, even though the actuarial accrued liability in 2001 was calculated using the maximum cost-of-living adjustment authorized by statute and the 2011 liability was calculated using no cost-of-living liability. In light of the lower funded ratio, the Wyoming retirement board recommended and the Legislature enacted in 2010 a combined employer and employee contribution increase from eleven and twenty-five hundredths percent (11.25%) to fourteen and twelve hundredths percent (14.12%) effective September 1, 2010;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1aviii">
         Actuarial funded ratios have fallen over the past decade for all other plans identified in this section, other than the judicial retirement plan. The funded ratio of the volunteer firefighter’s plan and the firefighter’s plan B have dropped by over fifty (50) percentage points. These decreases were incurred in spite of a change in assumptions from a maximum cost-of-living increase allowed by statute to no cost-of-living increase, except for the paid firemen plan A;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1aix">
         From 1991 through 2008, cost-of-living increases ranging from one percent (1%) to three percent (3%) were provided for eighteen (18) consecutive years in the largest public employee retirement plan, resulting in cumulative increases in an employee’s benefit amount ranging from one and three-hundredths (1.03%) for employees first eligible for a cost-of-living adjustment in 2008 to thirty-four percent (34%) for those eligible for a cost-of-living adjustment in 1991;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1ax">
         Other benefit increases have been provided by legislation, including a 2001 enactment of an increased benefit multiplier for each year of service in the largest plan, which resulted in an increased cost of over five hundred twenty-one million dollars ($521,000,000.00) through July 1, 2011. An ad hoc increase of three dollars ($3.00) per month per year of service made in the same legislation resulted in over two hundred seventeen million dollars ($217,000,000.00) in increased costs to the plan over the same period;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1axi">
         As of January 1, 2011, it is estimated that over forty (40) years will be required until the largest public employee plan currently administered by the Wyoming retirement board meets a one hundred percent (100%) actuarial funded ratio. Other plans administered by the Wyoming retirement board, volunteer firefighters pension board and volunteer emergency medical technician’s pension board have higher or lower funded ratios;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1axii">
         Stability in providing stated benefits is a critical feature of a retirement plan. With large portions of public employee retirement plans invested in markets and with market fluctuations having a significant effect on funded ratios, actuarial funded ratios in excess of one hundred percent (100%) are necessary to maximize stability in providing stated benefits;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1axiii">
         It is the intent of the legislature that all public employee retirement plans be managed to maintain an actuarial funded ratio of not less than one hundred percent (100%) and that the retirement board determine from time to time an appropriate level of funding sufficient to withstand market fluctuations without experiencing reductions below the desired one hundred percent (100%) funding ratio;
        </li>
        <li id="t09c03a04d02s9-3-453ol1axiv">
         It is the intent of the legislature that cost-of-living increases and changes to multipliers be allowed only in the event that the actuarial funded level for the affected plan remains above one hundred percent (100%), plus the additional percentage the retirement board determines is reasonably necessary to withstand market fluctuations. This determination is to be made for the entire amortization period affected by the change using then current actuarial assumptions.

      Laws 2009, ch. 90, § 4 provides: “It is the intent of this act to impose a fiscal year of July 1 through June 30 on all governmental entities in this state, including all agencies, boards, commissions, institutions, instrumentalities, political subdivisions and special districts, no matter how formed, unless specifically exempted or otherwise authorized by law.
      The intent of this act is to repeal any noncodified provision which conflicts with the provisions of this act, including but not limited to earlier adopted government reorganization acts.
      Any entity required to change its current fiscal year of operation may elect to extend its current fiscal year or shorten its current fiscal year and commence its next fiscal year on July 1, 2009 or July 1, 2010, as it finds most convenient and efficient for its circumstances.”

      Whenever it appears to the state board of equalization that there will not be sufficient money in the general fund to pay the expenses of supporting the state charitable institutions in addition to paying the other expenses authorized to be paid from the general fund by legislative appropriation, the board of equalization, at the time of making the annual assessment for state purposes, may direct the boards of county commissioners of the several counties to levy on all taxable property a special tax not exceeding one (1) mill on each dollar of the assessed valuation thereof, for the purpose of raising sufficient money which, together with the money available therefor in the general fund, is sufficient to pay the expenses of supporting the state charitable institutions as authorized by the legislature. The money raised by the special tax shall be credited to the general fund.

       Revenues received under W.S. 9-4-601(a)(vi) and (b)(i) shall be credited to a capital construction account. No money shall be expended from the account until the money has been appropriated by the legislature to the state loan and investment board through the normal budget process to be used in the board’s discretion for any purpose authorized by this section. The revenues shall be used to finance state revenue bonds as provided by this section. The balance shall be used for the making of loans or grants to incorporated cities and towns, counties and special districts as provided in this section. No loan or grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under the provisions of this section until the loan or grant application has been referred by the board to a state agency for review as determined by the board. The state agency shall provide the board with a written review of any loan or grant application referred to the agency and any other assistance requested by the board. No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any county unless the county imposes at least eleven (11) or ninety-one and sixty-seven one-hundredths percent (91.67%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 5 of the Wyoming constitution, or unless the county is imposing the optional sales tax authorized under W.S. 39-15-204(a)(i) or (iii). No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any municipality unless the municipality imposes at least seven (7) or eighty-seven and five-tenths percent (87.5%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 6 of the Wyoming constitution. No grant shall be made by the state loan and investment board under this section to any special district or other lawful entity which imposes less than eighty percent (80%) of any authorized mill levy. The state loan and investment board may waive the taxation requirements imposed by this subsection for good cause shown such as other funding sources, but in no case shall the state loan and investment board authorize any grant to any municipality under this section which does not impose at least two (2) or twenty-five percent (25%) of the available mills authorized by article 15, section 6 of the Wyoming constitution. The state loan and investment board shall grant money as authorized by this section only when the board finds the grant is necessary to:

     <p>
      A bank applying to be a state depository shall file a written application with the secretary of the board of deposits. The application shall be accompanied by a sworn statement of the financial condition of the bank at the time the application is made and a certified resolution providing proper authority of the depository. The secretary of the board of deposits shall review all applications, prepare a recommendation regarding each, and submit a list of all applicants and his recommendations to the board. The secretary of the board shall prepare a list of all financial institutions of the state which are approved by the board to be depositories. The chairman and the secretary of the board shall certify the list to the bank collateral officer who is designated by the state treasurer. Once the bank collateral officer is designated, the state treasurer shall provide a written order to the bank declaring it a state depository until its authority is revoked by the board. Each year, designated state depositories shall submit a current statement of condition, a certified copy of a resolution indicating its authority to act as a state depository has not been revoked and any other information the secretary of the board deems necessary. If, at any time state funds are on deposit with a state depository, a state depository is subject to any public enforcement action by any federal or state regulatory entity, the state depository shall notify the secretary of the board of the regulatory action if the action is not confidential. The board may revoke a bank’s designation as a state depository at any time except that no time deposit, open account shall be withdrawn from a state depository prior to the date of maturity without providing forty-five (45) days prior written notice, absent a default by the state depository.

      Instead of furnishing a surety bond as security for the deposits, a depository may pledge any bonds, debentures and other securities in which the state treasurer may by law invest and in an amount equal, at least, to the maximum amount of money at any time to be deposited with the bank. The bonds, debentures and other securities so pledged shall have a market value at least equal to the amount of the deposit. In addition, any depository may furnish as security for the deposit letters of credit issued by any Federal Home Loan Bank in such form as approved by the state treasurer of Wyoming or pledge conventional first mortgages of Wyoming real estate and notes connected with the mortgages at a ratio of one and one-half to one (1.5:1) of the value of public funds secured by them. A pledge of collateral as security for the deposit of public funds shall be accompanied by a written assignment from the depository vesting legal title thereto to the state and by any other instruments required by the state treasurer. The assignment shall provide that the depository shall pay over deposited public funds and accrued interest thereon to the state treasurer, or his authorized deputy, upon check, order or demand in accordance with this article. The assignment shall also provide that the state has the authority, if the depository defaults, to sell all collateral necessary to realize the full amount of deposited public funds and interest accrued thereon. The interest on bonds, debentures and other securities, so pledged, when paid shall be remitted to the bank so pledging them, as long as it is not in default.

      The state treasurer may sell any or all collateral that may be pledged as security for the deposit of any state funds in any depository under this act, at public or private sale, whenever there shall be a failure or refusal upon the part of any state depository, to pay over the funds, or any part thereof or interest thereon, upon the demand or order of the state treasurer, or his authorized deputy on the state depository. Notice of the sale of collateral given as security for deposits is required only if the state treasurer finds that the collateral is illiquid. If notice is required, it shall be given by publication once each week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which real estate, in the case of mortgages, or the local governments, in the case of local government bonds, are located. When a sale of collateral is made by the state treasurer, either at public or private sale, and the collateral has been transferred by the chairman and secretary of the board of deposits, the absolute ownership of the collateral shall vest in the purchasers, upon the payment of the purchase money to the state treasurer. Should there be any surplus after paying the amount due the state and expenses of sale, it shall be paid to the state depository which made the pledge of the collateral.

       . The program is intended to benefit the university by providing supplemental coverage for payment of bonded indebtedness of the university thereby reducing the interest rate at which the bonds may be issued.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1b">
       If the university seeks supplemental coverage for its revenue bonds under this program, the university shall apply to the board on forms prescribed by the board following legislative authorization of the university to issue revenue bonds. In no case shall the board approve supplemental coverage for bonds if the sale of the bonds would reduce the ratio of university pledged revenue that is available for debt servicing to the cost of interest and principal payments to a level of less than one (1) to one (1). The board shall review the application and determine whether to approve the application based upon:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1bi">
         Whether supplemental coverage under this section would likely result in reduced costs;

        <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1bii">
         Any other factor relevant to the issue and supplemental coverage for payment of the bonds which are the subject of the application.

      </li>
      <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1c">
       The board may determine to provide supplemental coverage for revenue bonds under this section and may impose terms, conditions and limits on that supplemental coverage as it finds, in its discretion, are necessary to protect state funds and ensure the viability of the program. In addition, the board may provide supplemental coverage for refunding of revenue bonds issued on or before November 1, 2015, provided the refunding is not combined with any bonds issued after November 1, 2015. A decision by the board not to approve supplemental coverage for revenue bonds under this section is not subject to judicial review under the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act.
      </li>
      <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1d">
       As a condition of participating in the supplemental coverage program under this section, the university shall enter into agreements necessary to provide that:

        <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1di">
         The state of Wyoming, through the state treasurer, shall assume responsibility for and make all payments to the university’s paying agent in the amount necessary to pay principal and interest on the bonds subject to the supplemental coverage;

        <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1dii">
         The university shall deposit funds with the state by a certain date and in a sufficient amount so that the state can make the entire principal and interest payment to the university’s paying agent in a timely manner;

           To the extent that the university has not deposited sufficient funds with the state to comply with paragraph (ii) of this subsection, the state is deemed to have loaned and the university is deemed to have borrowed those funds subject to the following terms and conditions:

            <li id="t09c04a10s9-4-1003ol1diiiBII">
             The loan, including principal and interest, shall be repaid from revenues from the university’s general fund that are neither state appropriations to the university nor pledged revenues under W.S. 21-17-404(a)(xiv)(A). The loan is not deemed to be a general obligation of the university, and the state shall not require repayment from any source other than as provided in this subdivision;

Wyoming's capitol restoration legislation assigns all aspects of the project to the governor and other officials and groups created by the legislature.

       Whenever any property escheats or is forfeited to the state for its use, the legal title vests in the state from the time of the escheat or forfeiture. A complaint may be filed by the county attorney of the proper county or by the attorney general in the name of the state of Wyoming against the person or bank which possesses the escheated or forfeited property, in the district court of the proper county for the recovery of the property, alleging the grounds on which the recovery is claimed, and like proceedings in judgment shall be had as in a civil action for the recovery of property. In any such action due proof that any real or personal property has been unclaimed for five (5) years immediately prior to the time of filing the complaint and that the name or whereabouts of the owner of the property is unknown is prima facie evidence of the failure of title to the property for want of legal heirs.

       In cases where probate proceedings are commenced upon the estate of any person without known heirs no action under subsection (a) of this section need be brought. The court having jurisdiction of the estate shall enter a decree in the estate, distributing the unclaimed property remaining for distribution in the estate to the state of Wyoming. Where probate proceedings have been commenced but have never been completed, the county attorney or attorney general may proceed as provided by subsection (a) of this section. In any such estate, the failure of any heirs or devisees of the deceased to appear and establish a claim within the time fixed by the notice of final settlement of the estate for filing objections to the final account and petition for distribution is prima facie evidence of the failure of title to the property of the estate for want of legal heirs or devisees.

       In all cases in which any property, or any refunds, dividends or other payments are ordered to be conveyed or paid to persons in the state of Wyoming by a decree, judgment or order of any court or governmental agency, and the property, refunds, dividends or other payments are not claimed by the person entitled thereto within the time fixed or limited by the order of the court or governmental agency directing the payment thereof, the property, refunds, dividends or other payments are the property of the state of Wyoming, subject to subsection (d) of this section. At the expiration of the fixed or limited time, the court or governmental agency shall enter the proper decree, judgment or order directing that the property escheat to the state of Wyoming.

After expiration of the five (5) year period without lawful claim, the funds shall be credited to the common school permanent land fund account. All real and personal property obtained by the state of Wyoming by escheat or forfeiture shall be received by and shall be under the direction and control of the state treasurer who shall give a receipt to the court therefor. The property shall be held in kind, except as hereinafter provided, by the state treasurer for a period of five (5) years during which time it is subject to claims by the rightful owners who may file their claims in the court which had original jurisdiction of the property. After the expiration of the five (5) year period without lawful claim therefor, the state treasurer shall sell the personal property at public or private sale, and shall sell the real property in the manner provided in W.S.

      <p>
       The party states recognize that the proper employment of scientific and technological discoveries and advances in nuclear and related fields and direct and collateral application and adaptation of processes and techniques developed in connection therewith, properly correlated with the other resources of the region, can assist substantially in the industrial progress of the West and the further development of the economy of the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from nuclear and related scientific or technological resources, facilities and skills requires systematic encouragement, guidance, assistance, and promotion from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for such a cooperative effort in nuclear and related fields, to enhance the economy of the West and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.

        Article I POLICY AND PURPOSE
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       The party states recognize that low-level radioactive wastes are generated by essential activities and services that benefit the citizens of the states. It is further recognized that the protection of the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes can be accomplished through cooperation of the states in minimizing the amount of handling and transportation required to dispose of such wastes and through the cooperation of the states in providing facilities that serve the region. It is the policy of the party states to undertake the necessary cooperation to protect the health and safety of the citizens of the party states and to provide for the most economical management of low-level radioactive wastes on a continuing basis. It is the purpose of this compact to provide the means for such a cooperative effort among the party states so that the protection of the citizens of the states and the maintenance of the viability of the states' economies will be enhanced while sharing the responsibilities of radioactive low-level waste management.

        Article III REGULATORY PRACTICES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Each party state hereby agrees to adopt practices which will require low-level waste shipments originating within its borders and destined for a facility within another party state to conform to the applicable packaging and transportation requirements and regulations of the host state. Such practices shall include:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIII.25ol11">
        Maintaining an inventory of all generators within the state that have shipped or expect to ship low-level waste to facilities in another party state;
       </li>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIII.25ol12">
        Periodic unannounced inspection of the premises of such generators and the waste management activities thereon;
       </li>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIII.25ol13">
        Authorization of the containers in which such waste may be shipped, and a requirement that generators use only that type of container authorized by the state;
       </li>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIII.25ol14">
        Assurance that inspections of the carriers which transport such waste are conducted by proper authorities, and appropriate enforcement action taken for violations;
       </li>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIII.25ol15">
        After receiving notification from a host state that a generator within the party state is in violation of applicable packaging or transportation standards, the party state will take appropriate action to assure that such violations do not recur. Such action may include inspection of every individual low-level waste shipment by that generator.
        <p>
         Each party state may impose fees upon generators and shippers to recover the cost of the inspections and other practices under this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit any party state's authority to impose additional or more stringent standards on generators or carriers than those required under this article.

       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIV.26ol11">
        Facilities located in any party state, other than facilities established or maintained by individual low-level waste generators for the management of their own low-level waste, shall accept low-level waste generated in any party state if such waste has been packaged and transported according to applicable laws and regulations.

        Until such time as paragraph (2) of article IV takes effect, facilities located in any party state may accept low-level waste generated outside of any of the party states only if such waste is accompanied by a certificate of compliance issued by an official of the state in which such waste shipment originated. Such certificate shall be in such form as may be required by the host state, and shall contain at least the following:
        <p>
         <b>
          (A)

         <b>
          (C)
         </b>
         A statement that the low-level waste being shipped has been inspected by the official who issued the certificate or by his agent or by a representative of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and found to have been packaged in compliance with applicable federal regulations and such additional requirements as may be imposed by the host state;
        </p>
        <p>
         <b>
          (D)

       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIV.26ol14">
        Each party state shall cooperate with the other party states in determining the appropriate site of any facility that might be required within the region comprised of the party states, in order to maximize public health and safety while minimizing the use of any one (1) party state as the host of such facilities on a permanent basis. Each party state further agrees that decisions regarding low-level waste management facilities in their region will be reached through a good faith process which takes into account the burdens borne by each of the party states as well as the benefits each has received.
       </li>
       <li id="t09c06a02s9-6-206-aIV.26ol15">
        The party states recognize that the issue of hazardous chemical waste management is similar in many respects to that of low-level waste management. Therefore, in consideration of the state of Washington allowing access to its low-level waste disposal facility by generators in other party states, party states such as Oregon and Idaho which host hazardous chemical waste disposal facilities will allow access to such facilities by generators within other party states. Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent any party state from limiting the nature and type of hazardous chemical or low-level wastes to be accepted at facilities within its borders or from ordering the closure of such facilities, so long as such action by a host state is applied equally to all generators within the region comprised of the party states.

        Any host state may establish a schedule of fees and requirements related to its facility, to assure that closure, perpetual care, and maintenance and contingency requirements are met, including adequate bonding.

     This chapter does not violate art. 16, § 6, Wyo. Const., on the ground that it constitutes lending of the public credit for a private purpose provided no debt is created in the state beyond the current year's taxes. Any private benefit is purely incidental and not within constitutional prohibitions. Witzenburger v. State, 575 P.2d 1100,

     Section 10, ch. 202, Laws 1975, which appropriates funds for the administration of the Wyoming community development authority, does not violate art. 3, § 34, Wyo. Const., on the ground that the section is not related to the ordinary expenses of the legislative, executive and judicial departments of the state, and should be enacted by a separate bill embracing one subject, since there is no constitutional limitation on the creation of a separate body corporate, as a state instrumentality, to perform governmental functions having a public purpose. With that right goes the implied authority to lend financial support for purely administrative purposes. Witzenburger v. State, 575 P.2d 1100,

     <p>
      The authority shall require as a condition to receiving any of its money under this chapter that any mortgage lender receiving money, within the limitation imposed by the amount of money received, shall give reasonable priority to mortgage loan applications made directly to the mortgage lender by qualified, individual home purchasers, before committing any money received from the authority to contractors, builders, real estate developers or real estate agents, except to the extent the authority determines there is a need to encourage the construction of affordable housing and it is reasonable and appropriate to provide or permit commitments to alleviate such need. Any money committed by a mortgage lender to an individual home purchaser under this act may be used for the purchase of new or existing residential dwellings.

       Subsection (a) of this section does not apply to an employee who has reported or caused to be reported a violation or unsafe condition or practice, unless the employee has first brought the alleged violation, condition or practice to the attention of a person having supervisory authority over the employee and has allowed the state employer a reasonable opportunity to correct that violation, condition or practice. Prior notice to a person having supervisory authority is not required if the employee reasonably believes that the report may not result in prompt correction of the violation, condition or practice. In such cases, the employee shall report the violation, condition or practice to the department or agency director of the state entity with which he is employed or to the office of the governor. In the event the alleged violation, condition or practice occurred within the office of the governor, the employee may report the violation, condition or practice to the office of the secretary of state.

An employee’s recovery from any action under this section shall be limited to reinstatement of his previous job, payment of back wages and re-establishment of employee benefits to which he would have otherwise been entitled if the violation had not occurred. In addition, the court may allow the prevailing party his costs together with reasonable attorney’s fees to be taxed by the court. Any employee found to have knowingly made a false report shall be subject to disciplinary action by his employer up to and including dismissal.
