     History of title. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 1, ch. 188, Laws 1977, revised this title, substituting §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c01s1-1-101" target="_self">1-1-101</a></cite> to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-102" target="_self">1-39-102</a></cite> for §§ 1-1 to 1-1066, W.S. 1957. The original Code of Civil Procedure was enacted as Laws 1886, ch. 60, and consisted of 809 sections. This title, as revised, is based on the original code and many laws which, although not enacted as part of the Civil Code, also relate to civil procedure. For disposition of acts, see the Table of Disposition of Acts. Attention is called to the fact that many provisions of the original Civil Code, and many laws inserted therein in prior compilations, were superseded by the Rules of Civil Procedure, adopted by the supreme court effective December 1, 1957. See Rule 86, W.R.C.P.
   </p>
   <p>
    Inasmuch as there is no chapter 16 in the 1977 revision of title 1 by § 1, ch. 188, Laws 1977, the chapters following chapter 15 have been renumbered so as to maintain proper numerical sequence and internal references in the statutes have been changed accordingly throughout the title.
   </p>
   <p>
    Section 2, ch. 188, Laws 1977, reads: “Any other act adopted by the Wyoming Legislature during the same session which this act is adopted shall be given precedence and shall prevail over the amendments in this act to the extent that such acts are in conflict herewith.”

       Appellants asserted that part of the statute that prohibited partial assignment of judgments, but corporate appellees’ partial assignments of their judgment against appellants did not deprive appellants of the benefit of their judgments against individual appellees, as appellants still received value for their judgments by having the amount appellants owed reduced.

    Voluntary partial payment of liability claims.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      No voluntary partial
   payment of a claim based on alleged liability for injury or property
   damage shall be construed as an admission of fault or liability, or
   as a waiver or release of claim by the person receiving payment. Such
   payment is not admissible as evidence in any action for the purpose
   of determining the amount of any judgment, with respect to the parties
   to the occurrence from which the claim arose. Upon settlement of the
   claim, the parties may make any agreement they desire in respect to
   all voluntary partial payments. After entry of judgment, any such
   payment shall be treated as a credit and deducted from the amount
   of the judgment. If after partial voluntary payments are made it is
   determined by final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
   that the payor is liable for an amount less than the voluntary payments
   already made, the payor has no right of action for the recovery of
   amounts by which the voluntary payments exceed the final judgment.
   No voluntary partial payments shall be construed to reduce the amount
   of damages which may be pleaded and proved in a court proceeding between
   the parties.

        Negligence on part of fraud victim. —

      </p>
      <p>
       It seems clear the legislature sought to ensure negligent defendants would not be held accountable for the intentional acts of another, and the Wyoming Supreme Court is not persuaded the legislature intended negligence on the part of a fraud victim to be compared with the intentional acts of the perpetrator so as to reduce the perpetrator's liability based upon any percentage of fault apportioned to the victim. Erdelyi v. Lott, 2014 WY 48, 326 P.3d 165, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 51</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent clear statutory language showing the legislature intended the negligence of a fraud victim to be compared to the conduct of the perpetrator, thereby potentially reducing the latter's liability for his intentionally wrongful acts, the court declines to hold that the statute is a proper matter for a jury instruction in a fraud case. Erdelyi v. Lott, 2014 WY 48, 326 P.3d 165, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 51</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred in instructing on comparative fault and negligence so as to allow the jury to compare the stockbroker's willful act with any negligence of the client in this constructive fraud case, and the district court further erred in providing a verdict form requiring the jury to compare the stockbroker's constructive fraud and any negligence of the client. Erdelyi v. Lott, 2014 WY 48, 326 P.3d 165, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 51</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       If a jury finds that a claimant knew or could have discovered the fraud more than four years before filing the action, the perpetrator of the fraud is relieved from any liability, and thus any negligence of the claimant in not discovering and timely pursuing a fraud claim is addressed in the statute, and there is no need for a separate instruction allowing a jury to compare a claimant's negligence or comparative fault with the willful act of the perpetrator in a fraud case; on remand, the jury was not to be instructed on comparative fault as between the client and the stockbroker.

       Evidence was sufficient to support the finding by the jury of total damages of $150,000, and where the jury attributed 45% of the fault to plaintiff for her injuries, pursuant to the comparative fault statute, defendant's liability was reduced to 55% of the $ 150,000.

   What is contemplated by the comparative negligence statute is that the totality of the causal negligence present in the case will be examined to determine the contribution each party has made to that whole. It is the “respective contributions to the result” which determine who is most negligent, and by how much. Connett v. Fremont County Sch. Dist., 581 P.2d 1097, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 209</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

      <p>
       Since the law of this state is to the effect that there is no duty to remove or warn of an obvious danger or one that is known to the person injured, no change was accomplished in that law by the adoption of comparative negligence. Sherman v. Platte County, 642 P.2d 787, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 321</cite> (Wyo. 1982).

       “Known and obvious danger” rule did not negate city's duty
   
   to keep its streets and sidewalks in a reasonably safe condition and in reasonably good repair, but the obvious danger of the streets resulting from accumulations of loose gravel after resurfacing could be considered by the trier of fact to determine the plaintiff's percentage of negligence.

      </p>
      <p>
       Absent the legislature's express intention to abrogate the natural accumulation and obvious-danger rules, the rules survive the adoption of comparative negligence. Therefore, the rule remains that an owner or occupier of premises will not be liable for injuries resulting from a slip and fall on a natural accumulation of ice and snow. Eiselein v. K-Mart, 868 P.2d 893, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       An owner or occupier of premises owes a duty to prevent injuries resulting from an unnatural accumulation of ice which will be found if the owner or occupier creates an accumulation of water in a manner substantially different in volume or course than would naturally have occurred. Eiselein v. K-Mart, 868 P.2d 893, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even the most ably constructed and carefully maintained parking lot will probably contain minor indentions in which naturally occurring water can accumulate and freeze. Naturally occurring water which naturally concentrates in such a lot is still considered a natural accumulation, for which the owner or occupier is not liable. Eiselein v.

      <p>
       A nonsettling defendant, found to be 100% at fault, was not entitled to credit the amount the plaintiff received from settling defendants against the judgment he had to pay. Credit need not be given, because the amount of judgment for which each defendant is liable is always limited by the percentage of fault assigned to that defendant. Haderlie v.

      <p>
       The former first two sentences of this section are unconstitutional

      <p>
       Use of phrase, “In all cases,”
   
   in this section, permitting advice to the jury concerning the effect of the percentage findings in its verdict under the comparative negligence statute, conveys a clear and commonly understood meaning which can be applied in a fashion consistent with the other provisions of the statute. The phrase relates to a class of civil actions which are characterized as personal injury or wrongful death and refers without exception to all cases which fall into this class. Johnson v. Safeway Stores, 568 P.2d 908, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 315</cite> (Wyo. 1977) (decided under prior law).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature, by its enactment of this section, manifested a clear intendment for its provisions to apply without exception to all personal injury actions, including those cases brought by “any person or his legal representative to recover damages for negligence resulting in death or in injury to person or property.” Johnson v. Safeway Stores, 568 P.2d 908, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 315</cite> (Wyo. 1977) (decided under prior law).

       Once a skier asked a resort employee how to exit the advanced terrain park area without “taking” any of the features, the resort had a duty to provide her with appropriate instructions, which might have included a specific warning to beware of the drop into the half-pipe at the end of the catwalk that provided an exit out of the terrain park area, and the trial court erred when it found that the risk of falling into the half-pipe was an inherent risk of the skier's alpine skiing and that therefore the resort did not owe her a duty under the Recreation Safety Act.

       In answer to two certified questions, the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that Wyoming's Recreational Safety Act (RSA), Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c01s1-1-121" target="_self">1-1-121</a></cite> et seq., does not apply to a cause of action based upon the design or manufacture of sport or recreational equipment or products or safety equipment used incidental to or required by the sport or recreational opportunity. That exemption does not exclude the operation of a ski lift by a recreational provider from the protections of the RSA.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c01s1-1-121" target="_self">1-1-121</a></cite> et seq., is, in part, a products liability statute that is unambiguous on its face and the RSA does not necessarily exclude a ski lift from its protections. The inherent risks of skiing are not limited only to the act of skiing, and an injury suffered while boarding a ski lift (with skis stowed on the exterior of the lift) may be an inherent risk of skiing.

       Company that provided guided horseback rides in a wilderness area of a national park was entitled to summary judgment on a negligence claim by the estate of a horseback rider because any risks associated with spooked, runaway horses, including the rider’s fall from the horse, were inherent in the activity of horseback riding, and, pursuant to the Wyoming Recreation Safety Act, the company owed no duty to protect the rider from the inherent risks of horseback riding.

       Because horseback
   riding is considered a sport or recreational opportunity under this
   section, a provider was not required to eliminate, alter, or control
   the inherent risks associated with horseback riding, and any person
   who chose to take part in the provider's horseback riding services
   assumed all inherent risks which were associated with that activity.
   As a result, a rider could not sue the provider for negligence if
   the damage, injury or death alleged in her complaint was the result
   of an inherent risk of horseback riding. Kovnat v. Xanterra Parks & Resorts, 770 F.3d 949, 2014 U.S. App. LEXIS 20140 (10th Cir. Wyo. 2014).

       In reviewing summary judgment granted for a ski resort on the basis of the Wyoming Recreation Safety Act, the court defined the risk at the level of specificity supported by the record, and asked: Whether encountering boulders, and gaps between them, in changing snow conditions in an off-piste area of a ski resort was an “inherent risk” of alpine skiing?

       Action against a ski resort was properly decided on the basis of summary judgment because boulders and the gaps of widely varying dimensions between them—at times exposed to the elements and at others lightly covered by fresh snow—were an inherent risk of skiing an off-piste run. The provider did nothing to exacerbate the inherent risk posed by the hazard. Roberts v. Jackson Hole Mt. Resort Corp., 884 F.3d 967, 2018 U.S. App. LEXIS 5552 (10th Cir. Wyo. 2018).

   loose because,
   when the cinching of a saddle can be too tight or

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c01s1-1-121" target="_self">1-1-121</a></cite> et seq., does not apply to a cause of action based upon the design or manufacture of sport or recreational equipment or products or safety equipment used incidental to or required by the sport or recreational opportunity. That exemption does not exclude the operation of a ski lift by a recreational provider from the protections of the RSA.

       Under the Wyoming Recreation Safety Act, there were no issues of material fact about the duty in a snowboarding fatality case when the question was whether the loss of control by an experienced 16 year old snowboarder, familiar with a man-made tabletop jump, was an inherent risk when the jump was altered the night before the accident, tested the morning of the accident, used throughout the day, and located in a specially designed roped-off terrain park containing other man-made jumps and warning signs on national forest land.

       Once a skier asked a resort employee how to exit the advanced terrain park area without “taking” any of the features, the resort had a duty to provide her with appropriate instructions, which might have included a specific warning to beware of the drop into the half-pipe at the end of the catwalk that provided an exit out of the terrain park area, and the trial court erred when it found that the risk of falling into the half-pipe was an inherent risk of the skier's alpine skiing and that therefore the resort did not owe her a duty under the Recreation Safety Act.

       In an action against a ski resort, conclusory expert testimony was not itself enough to preclude summary judgment under the Wyoming Recreation Safety Act.

       In an action by the owner of a funeral home against the county coroner and the owner of another funeral home alleging a protected property interest in a rotation policy established by the coroner, the evidence was sufficient to support a jury verdict on the cross-claim of the defendant funeral home owner for stalking where (1) the plaintiff told the defendant that he would ruin him financially and in terms of his reputation, (2) after the defendant opened his funeral home, the plaintiff followed him around the community at least once a month, (3) the defendant, who also operated an ambulance service, testified that the plaintiff often drove to the scene of an ambulance call and watched him, and (4) the jury saw a remarkably complex diagram created by the plaintiff with the defendant's name in the middle surrounded by the names of 14 other members of the community.

      <p>
       Finding that a ranch's action seeking damages resulting from a corporation's failure to provide engineering and surveying services was time-barred was appropriate because, whether Wyo. Stat. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c03s1-3-107" target="_self">1-3-107</a></cite> began to run on the date of the act, error or omission, or on the date the cause of action accrued, the lawsuit was untimely. The ranch's cause of action was time barred if not commenced within two years of the act, error or omission giving rise to the cause of action, or if, the two-year time limit started to run upon “accrual” of the cause of action, the ranch's claim was still time barred because the cause of action accrued on or before May 5, 2005.

        Adverse possession is based upon running of statute of limitations

        Statements

   property or members of the community, can be evidence every bit as
   objective and relevant as the nonverbal act of erecting a banner
   of
   conquest on a neighbor's land; the district court erred when it
   found
   that no statements of subjective intent were relevant to either
   prove
   or disprove adverse possession. Galiher v. Johnson, 2017 WY 31, 391 P.3d 1101, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 31</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

       <p>
        Purpose of adverse possession statute
   
   is to establish title good against world where right formerly possessed by others was forfeited by adverse possession, regardless of whether former rights were founded upon mere lien, security deed or upon absolute, unconditional title.

       <p>
        The prime object in prescribing how adverse possession shall be made manifest, of what elements or requisites it shall be composed, is to advise the real owner that his ownership is in danger, and the law has deemed the time fixed as sufficiently long, so as to give him ample opportunity to protect his right; and if he fails to do so, when thus advised, within the time fixed, he is considered as having acquiesced in the transfer of ownership.

        Adverse possession of real estate is an actual, visible and exclusive appropriation of land, commenced and continued under a claim of right, with the intent to assert such claim against the true owner, and accompanied by such an invasion of the rights of the opposite party as to give him a cause of action. The possession must be hostile and under a claim of right; it must be actual, open, notorious, exclusive and continuous. Bryant v. Cadle, 18 Wyo. 64, 104 P. 23, <cite class="wy_code">1909 Wyo.

In addition, the flight easement utilized by airplanes was not created by the passage of the ordinance, but by federal and state declarations of public navigability and by repeated overflights which preceded the home owner's action by considerably more than the 10 years allowed by this section.

        Where continuous possession of plaintiff and predecessor in title was marred only by predecessor's absence from premises for five months at which time he deeded land to plaintiff and by fact that land thereafter was vacant four months before plaintiff's tenant moved in, the interruption did not, as matter of law, affect plaintiff's adverse possession.

        Void tax deed was admissible in action to quiet title in plaintiff on ground of 10 years' adverse possession for purpose of showing that plaintiff's possession has not been that of mere trespasser, but has at all times been under a claim of ownership or claim of title.

        In some circumstances, enclosing land in a fence is sufficient to “raise the flag” of an adverse claimant; however, a fence kept simply for convenience has no effect upon the true boundary between tracts of land and creates a permissive use.

        To constitute an abandonment of adverse possession, the act of relinquishment of possession or enjoyment must be accompanied by an intent to part permanently with claim of ownership. Bruch v. Benedict, 62 Wyo. 213, 165 P.2d 561, <cite class="wy_code">1946 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. 1946).

        If a claimant's possession is shown to be permissive, then he acquires no title by adverse possession. Meyer v. Ellis, 411 P.2d 338, <cite class="wy_code">1966 Wyo. LEXIS 137</cite> (Wyo. 1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where land is vacant, unoccupied and free to public use and travel until circumstances induce owners to enclose it, mere travel across the same without objection from the owners does not enable public to acquire road over it, the use being regarded as permissive rather than adverse. Board of County Comm'rs v. Patrick, 18 Wyo. 130, 104 P. 531, <cite class="wy_code">1909 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1909), reh'g denied, 18 Wyo. 130, 107 P. 748, <cite class="wy_code">1910 Wyo.

       </p>
       <p>
        A public roadway cannot be acquired by mere permissive public use. If the private landowner establishes through competent evidence that the public's use is merely permissive, the question of supervision, control or maintenance is irrelevant. If the landowner fails to establish permissive use, he is still entitled to a presumption of permissive use unless the public authority establishes that it has assumed supervision or control of the road or has kept it in repair. Koontz v. Superior, 746 P.2d 1264, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 558</cite> (Wyo. 1987).

        Failure on the part of the owner to interrupt or object to the public use of the street for the statutorily prescribed period of time cannot be equated to permissive use. Koontz v. Superior, 746 P.2d 1264, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 558</cite> (Wyo. 1987).

       <p>
        Where there was nothing in the record to indicate use prior to 1996 was anything other than permissive, the action was insufficient to establish adverse possession because it failed to satisfy the statutory ten-year period.

       <p>
        A showing of maintenance of a road by a town is necessary to prove a claim of right in the public, which is separate and distinct from the element of continuous public use. Maintenance need not be constant. The extent of maintenance required is only as much as may be necessary to keep the road in substantial repair or to put it in condition for public travel. Koontz v. Superior, 746 P.2d 1264, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 558</cite> (Wyo. 1987).

        A “cause of action” is said to accrue to any person when that person first comes to a right to bring an action, so the statute of limitations is never held to have commenced to run upon a note until it has become due, and the duty has devolved upon the party liable to make payment.

        Argument that
   laches is inapplicable whenever a statute of limitations governs
   a
   claim would completely abolish the doctrine of laches because all actions in Wyoming are governed by a statute of limitations, and
   this
   would frustrate the goal of securing the just, speedy, and inexpensive
   determination of every action; however, the role of laches in breach of contract cases covered by an applicable statute of limitations should be very limited in scope, and in the proper case, the defense of laches should be available to remedy not only the delay but the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the plaintiff's
   dilatory action. Windsor Energy Group, L.L.C. v. Noble, Energy, Inc., 2014 WY 96, 330 P.3d 285, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 112</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

Because this failure to remit was a recurring tort involving a series of tortious acts, each of which formed the basis of a separate claim, and each of which accrued when the husband, on different occasions throughout the years, received royalties and made no remittances, and the wife discovered, or could have discovered, that she was not receiving her royalty share, the wife could recover for her share of royalties received but not remitted by the husband within four years preceding the filing of her action.

       In a case
   relating to the theft and resale of beer, the discovery rule applied
   to the fraud and conversion statutes of limitation; however, whether
   the explanations for a delay in discovery were credible and reasonably
   diligent were questions for the jury. The parties disputed what steps
   were necessary to determine the cause of the beer losses and to determine
   who was involved in those losses. Robert L. Kroenlein Trust v. Kirchhefer, 2015 WY 127, 357 P.3d 1118, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 144</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       In action against former husband for recovery of overriding oil and gas royalties
   
   which were due to the former wife by virtue of an assignment of the same by the husband, as ordered in a divorce decree, but which were not remitted to her, the husband was guilty of conversion, so, therefore, the four-year limitation period of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c03s1-3-105ol1aivB" target="_self">1-3-105(a)(iv)(B)</a></cite> was applicable. Because this failure to remit was a recurring tort involving a series of tortious acts, each of which formed the basis of a separate claim, and each of which accrued when the husband, on different occasions throughout the years, received royalties and made no remittances, and the wife discovered, or could have discovered, that she was not receiving her royalty share, the wife could recover for her share of royalties received but not remitted by the husband within four years preceding the filing of her action. As to the rest, i.e., the royalties received but not remitted beyond this four-year period, she was barred. Young v. Young, 709 P.2d 1254, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo.

      <p>
       A plaintiff discovers an “alleged act, error or omission” within the meaning of subsection (a)(iv) when she learns that her harm resulted from the wrongful conduct of the defendant, not just when she discovers the harm itself. In a medical malpractice action, it did not matter what the plaintiff “suspected” or “should have known.” When she actually discovered the doctor's alleged wrong — his failure to diagnose her tumor, and the fact that he should have diagnosed it, given her symptoms and history — during the second year after its occurrence, she was entitled to rely on subsection (a)(iv).

       In an action brought by a town to quiet title to a one-half interest in minerals underlying property conveyed by defendant to the town 30 years before, defendant's cross-petition for reformation of the deed was barred by this section. Town of Glenrock v. Abadie, 71 Wyo. 414, 259 P.2d 766, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo.), reh'g denied, 72 Wyo. 111, 262 P.2d 393, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo.

      <p>
       In an action to quiet title, wherein a cross-petition was filed for reformation of a deed, the fact that the parties and their positions remained the same as they were when the deeds in question were made, and the rights of innocent purchasers for value without notice were not concerned, was no defense to the running of the statute of limitations upon the right of action for reformation of the deed. Town of Glenrock v. Abadie, 72 Wyo. 111, 262 P.2d 393, <cite class="wy_code">1953 Wyo. LEXIS 36</cite> (Wyo. 1953).

       After the cause of action for medical malpractice accrued, the
   defendant departed from the state of Wyoming, and then, as this section
   plainly states, during his absence, the statute of limitations was
   tolled. The policy behind the tolling provision in the statute of
   limitations was not rescinded by the existence of the long-arm statute
   (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.05.html#t05c01s5-1-107" target="_blank">5-1-107</a></cite>), since only if the plaintiff had known where to find

   operated to permit effective service.

       In the context of a survival action, “survive” means to continue to live or exist beyond the life, or existence of; to live through; to live on after passing through; to remain alive.

        Distinctions between survival and wrongful death statutes.
    —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The prime difference between survival and wrongful death statutes is that the survival statute merely continues a cause of action in existence. The injured party's claim after death is an asset of the estate, while the wrongful death statute creates a new cause of action for the benefit of designated persons who have suffered the loss of a loved one and provider. De Herrera v. Herrera, 565 P.2d 479, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 263</cite> (Wyo. 1977); Rosa v. Cantrell, 705 F.2d 1208, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 23413 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 821, 104 S. Ct. 85, 78 L. Ed. 2d 94, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 1117 (U.S. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Survival statutes permit the personal representative of the deceased to prosecute any claims for personal injury the deceased would have had but for his death but do not permit recovery for harms suffered by the decedent's family as a result of his death. De Herrera v. Herrera, 565 P.2d 479, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 263</cite> (Wyo. 1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The survival statute protects the creditors of the estate; the Wrongful Death Act does not. De Herrera v. Herrera, 565 P.2d 479, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 263</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

     <p>
      After filing an action
   in a court of competent jurisdiction the subject matter of which is
   the title to real property located in one (1) or more counties in
   this state, the plaintiff may file a certified copy of the complaint
   or a sworn notice of the pendency of the action in the office of the
   county clerk in the county or counties in which the real property
   is located. The notice shall contain the names of the parties, the
   object of the action and a description of the property before it shall
   operate as constructive notice to third parties in such counties.
   Notice shall be effective in the county where the action is filed
   without filing a document with the county clerk of that county. Constructive
   notice shall be effective as to property in the county in which the
   complaint is filed as of the date the complaint is filed and shall
   be effective as to property in any other county as of the date on
   which the notice is filed in the clerk’s office of that county.

   may be served or executed by the officer or person to whom it is sent

   office from which it is sent. In sending it, either the original or

   any document to be sent by telecommunication bears a seal, either
   private or official, it is not necessary for the operator to communicate
   a description of the seal or any words or device thereon, but the

        Change in venue due to pretrial publicity was not warranted.
    —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for change of venue due to pretrial publicity about defendant's crimes and a separate investigation in which he was a murder suspect because although there were 12 articles published about defendant none was sensational or inflammatory and the last was published three months before trial, and also because only five of 48 prospective jurors expressed concern about their ability to be impartial in light of the pretrial publicity, none of the five was seated on the jury, and the record did not indicate that it was difficult to seat an impartial jury. Urbigkit v. State, 2003 WY 57, 67 P.3d 1207, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 70</cite> (Wyo. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a murder case, a court properly denied defendant's motion for change of venue where the news articles were generally factual in nature, reporting information obtained from court documents and from a potential witness, and they were not sensational, inflammatory, or prejudicial. Defense counsel and the trial court appropriately and properly examined the jury venire, and there was no indication that the pretrial publicity made jury selection difficult or created such prejudice that a change of venue was necessary. Duke v. State, 2004 WY 120, 99 P.3d 928, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 157</cite> (Wyo. 2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 1062, 125 S. Ct. 2513, 161 L. Ed. 2d 1113, 2005 U.S. LEXIS 4397 (U.S. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In defendant's felony murder case, change of venue was not warranted, where sixty-five jurors were summoned for the trial, and of those, twelve had heard about the case, and each of those jurors was closely examined, and
   at the close of voir dire, defendant passed the jury for cause and had no objections to the jury selection process. Lemus v. State, 2007 WY 111, 162 P.3d 497, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 120</cite> (Wyo. 2007).

      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error to refuse a continuance under this section, applied for on the ground of the absence of a witness residing in another state, where defendant had relied on his promise to attend and made no effort to secure his testimony by deposition or his attendance by legal process. Chapman v. First Nat'l Bank, 26 Wyo. 138, 181 P. 360, <cite class="wy_code">1919 Wyo. LEXIS 8</cite> (Wyo.), reh'g denied, 26 Wyo. 156, 182 P. 91 (Wyo. 1919).

       Due diligence, in the context of a missing witness, is not satisfied when a party simply secures agreement from the witness that he will attend trial, but a party must make every reasonable effort to insure that his witness will be present. This can include alternate travel plans or schedules and the use of depositions to preserve important testimony. Carlson v. BMW Indus. Serv., 744 P.2d 1383, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo.

      <p>
       In defendant's sexual assault case, the court properly denied his
   motion for a continuance to allow time to locate a witness because
   defendant failed to establish that the witness could be located and
   his testimony procured within a reasonable time, the unavailable testimony
   lacked materiality, and the potential testimony was simply not compelling.

       The trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance when the defendants were involved in another case in another state and were unable to attend the trial. Even though the defendants were unable to file affidavits in support of their motion, their presence as parties was completely essential to the proper presentation of their case. If the plaintiffs and court personnel were inconvenienced by the delay, assessing costs may have been more appropriate than denying the defendants the right to defend their action in court. Tomash v.

       The granting or refusing of a request for a continuance of a trial of a case is ordinarily a matter within the sound discretion of the trial court under the circumstances of each case.

      <p>
       A trial judge who grants a continuance of a case, civil or criminal, set for trial based upon the mere request, whim or convenience of counsel without substantial or legal reason for such continuance is himself guilty of a species of discretionary abuse. Hays v. State, 522 P.2d 1004, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 209</cite> (Wyo. 1974).

      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a continuance when the defendants were involved in another case in another state and were unable to attend the trial. Even though the defendants were unable to file affidavits in support of their motion, their presence as parties was completely essential to the proper presentation of their case. If the plaintiffs and court personnel were inconvenienced by the delay, assessing costs may have been more appropriate than denying the defendants the right to defend their action in court. Tomash v. Evans, 704 P.2d 1296, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 530</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

       The court did not abuse its discretion in denying the husband's motion for a continuance of his divorce action on the alleged grounds that his wife, through her counterclaim filed nine days before trial, injected new issues into the case. The issues raised in the counterclaim — a request for divorce, and a request for alimony and certain property — were either raised perfunctorily or were previously raised in the answer to the complaint.

       Trial court properly denied a husband's request for a continuance because his counsel's late withdrawal was due to the husband's failure to cooperate and his obstruction of an orderly progression of a divorce action. Byrd v. Mahaffey, 2003 WY 137, 78 P.3d 671, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 167</cite> (Wyo. 2003).

      <p>
       District court did not abuse its discretion in denying a father's motion to continue a divorce proceeding because: (1) the matter had already been pending for quite some time; (2) the conflicts in the case were in large part due to the father keeping his son against court order; and (3) the father had been aware that the court date was upcoming and had been granted at least one continuance due to scheduling conflicts.

      </p>
      <p>
       Court reasonably concluded that continuance was not warranted.
   
   With respect to the alleged failure of the opposing party to respond to discovery, the requested discovery was specious, unnecessary, untimely and, in effect, a stalling tactic. Regarding the movant's unavailability to attend trial, the movant had voluntarily accepted out-of-state employment, thereby creating the asserted need for a continuance. Inskeep v.

      <p>
       Trial court did not err by denying defendant a new trial based on a juror's alleged mental incompetency because it could have concluded that defendant's showing fell short of raising any significant concern under this section. Defendant relied on a few jurors' nonspecific comments to the bailiff indicating that they could not understand the point of some of the juror's statements made during their deliberations, his own statements to the bailiff, and the district judge's observations.

       The clause in art. 1, § 9, Wyo. Const., in which the word “men” appeared was not inserted for the purpose of preventing the legislature from changing the statutes in effect in regard to the persons competent for jury service. The legislature was therefore entitled to enact ch. 61, Laws 1949, duly incorporated in this section, which permitted women to serve as petit jurors in criminal and civil cases in the district court. Such act did not violate the constitutional provision. State v. Yazzie, 67 Wyo. 256, 218 P.2d 482, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 13</cite> (Wyo. 1950).

       “Selected and returned,” as used in this section, relates to the preparation of the base jury list, which is the list of qualified jurors; because “selected and returned” is a reference to preparation of the base jury list, the critical date for measuring the duration of a prospective juror's residence in a county is April 1, the date on which the base jury list is certified. In other words, any juror who is a resident of a county for the ninety-day period preceding April 1 meets the residence qualification for service in that county; therefore, even though a juror was no longer a resident of the county, she was still qualified because she was a resident of the county in the 90-day period preceding April 1.

       “Selected and returned,” as used in this section, relates to the preparation of the base jury list, which is the list of qualified jurors; because “selected and returned” is a reference to preparation of the base jury list, the critical date for measuring the duration of a prospective juror's residence in a county is April 1, the date on which the base jury list is certified. In other words, any juror who is a resident of a county for the ninety-day period preceding April 1 meets the residence qualification for service in that county; therefore, even though a juror was no longer a resident of the county, she was still qualified because she was a resident of the county in the 90-day period preceding April 1.

       Defendant's convictions for possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver were proper because the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the jury panel; the motion was based upon the district court clerk's policy of selecting jurors from the master list in alphabetical order, rather than in a random selection process. Defendant failed to show that the method used deprived him of a fair cross section of the community or that any distinctive group was systematically excluded from the panel; however, that method was also not to be used in any future cases.

      If at any time during the empaneling of a jury all the names selected for the panel are exhausted, the court shall enter an order directing that such additional number of names as necessary be randomly selected from the base jury list.

The clerk shall notify the persons selected and not excused to appear in court immediately. The process shall continue from time to time when necessary until a jury is obtained.

    Procedure when sufficient number of jurors fail to attend.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If a sufficient number of jurors duly selected and notified do not attend to form a jury the court shall direct the clerk to select a sufficient number of names from the base jury list to complete the jury and shall summon the persons selected to attend immediately or at a time fixed by the court. If for any reason a sufficient number of jurors to try the issue is not obtained from the persons notified, the court may make successive orders until a sufficient number is obtained. The court may excuse any juror so selected if it appears that, because of distance, the delay occasioned by summoning the juror and requiring his presence would unduly prolong empaneling the trial jury. Each person so notified, unless excused by the court, shall serve as a juror at the trial. For a neglect or refusal to serve he may be fined in the same manner as a trial juror regularly selected and notified and he is subject to the same exceptions and challenges as any other trial juror.

      <p>
       Defendant's convictions for possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver were proper because the district court did not err in denying defendant's motion to quash the jury panel; the motion was based upon the district court clerk's policy of selecting jurors from the master list in alphabetical order, rather than in a random selection process. Defendant failed to show that the method used deprived him of a fair cross section of the community or that any distinctive group was systematically excluded from the panel; however, that method was also not to be used in any future cases.

       In the absence of anything to the contrary of which the court on appeal may properly take notice, it will be presumed that the court complied with its duty under this section to order the jury into the custody of an officer when they are not allowed to separate.

      <p>
       When defendant in capital case has shown separation of jury or opportunity for other parties, especially witnesses, to communicate with them, and it appears defendant was prejudiced or when it does not appear he was not prejudiced, new trial should be granted. State v. Goettina, 61 Wyo. 420, 158 P.2d 865, <cite class="wy_code">1945 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       New trial is properly refused because members of jury which had been ordered to be kept together went home for a short time by permission of a bailiff, it being satisfactorily shown that the separation did not serve as the occasion for the exercise of improper influences and that no one was prejudiced thereby.

       Juror's affidavits are admissible

       In a termination of parental rights proceeding, it was an abuse of discretion to grant a guardian ad litem (GAL) and a Department of Family Services (Department) separate peremptory challenges because the positions of the GAL and Department were not antagonistic.

       Parent could not attack the jury verdict on the basis of an improper allocation of peremptory challenges because the record failed to reveal which jurors the parent desired to empanel, that the state agency or guardian ad litem excluded. The record also failed to disclose which jurors, if any, the parent would have challenged had the parent been allotted additional peremptory challenges because at no point did the parent’s counsel object to the allocation of peremptory challenges, as counsel instead stated that counsel had no such objections.

       Where jurors sent the trial court a note asking, “If we cannot find solid proof of trespass, can we award damages?” and it answered “No” without the parties' counsel being present, plaintiffs were not entitled to new trial because (1) answering the question with a definitive “No” left no room for further confusion or undue emphasis on any particular instructions, (2) the jurors had been properly instructed on the burden of proof, and (3) the question did not indicate that the jury was confused about what “preponderance of the evidence” meant.

       Plaintiff was injured while assisting J. and E. in lowering an engine in defendant's shop under the orders of the gang “boss.” The jury found that in consequence of an order given by the “boss,” J. did not assist in removing the last timber from under the engine and that in consequence of his failure so to assist the accident occurred, and to that extent, the “boss” and J. were found negligent. They also found that three men were generally employed to do the work referred to, though two, one being in the pit under the engine, could do the work. Held, that the findings were inconsistent.

       The finding that two men were sufficient and that two were furnished does not warrant a judgment for defendant, it being inconsistent with the finding that the accident occurred in consequence of the third man being ordered away, and to strike out the latter and give effect to the former would be making a new verdict.

      <p>
       Following a jury verdict for special damages only, i.e., medical expenses, and an objection before the jury was discharged, in a motor vehicle accident case, the trial court erred in not returning the jury to continue their deliberations for the purpose of assessing general damages, i.e., pain and suffering.

        Effect of failure to object to form of verdict. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where no objection was made to the form of verdict given to the jury and no objection seems to have been raised when they returned it, so as to give an opportunity for correction, the objection came too late after the jury was discharged. De Witty v. Decker, 383 P.2d 734, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 1963); Anderson v. Foothill Indus. Bank, 674 P.2d 232, <cite class="wy_code">1984 Wyo. LEXIS 239</cite> (Wyo. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       When a verdict is not in proper form and the jury is not required to clarify it, any error in the verdict is waived by the party relying thereon who at the time of its rendition failed to make any request that its informality or uncertainty be corrected. De Witty v. Decker, 383 P.2d 734, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Having in mind the plain purpose of this section, to afford a jury the right to correct its own mistakes, it is not harsh or unreasonable to require a litigant, when an opportunity is afforded during the trial, timely, to bring a matter to the attention of the trial court in order that it might be corrected, and failing in this that he shall not be heard to complain, for to hold otherwise would seem unfair to the jury, to the trial court and to the other litigants, to say nothing of the unnecessary loss of time and expense. De Witty v. Decker, 383 P.2d 734, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the demonstrated reluctance of the jury to accept plaintiff's extensive claims at face value, it was incumbent upon her at least to attempt to see that a verdict in proper form was returned by the jury, and not having done so, the supreme court is not at liberty to grant relief. De Witty v. Decker, 383 P.2d 734, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant's failure to seek to correct any substantive defect in the special verdict when it was returned to the trial court was a waiver of his right to do so and he could not be heard to complain on appeal unless the doctrine of plain error would come to his rescue. Goggins v. Harwood, 704 P.2d 1282, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 526</cite> (Wyo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Challenges to irregular or inconsistent verdicts may be waived
   
   by the failure to object before the discharge of a jury. Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Donahue, 674 P.2d 1276, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 397</cite> (Wyo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there was no inherent error in telling the jury what the plaintiff's burden of proof was and that it must decide whether the plaintiff's injuries were caused by the alleged assault and battery, and then instructing the jury to assess damages without regard to its findings concerning the fact of the assault and whether or not it proximately caused any injuries, it was impossible to reconcile the jury's findings that there was an assault and battery and that the assault was not a “proximate cause of the injuries” with the testimony of the treating doctors who testified without conflict that the plaintiff in fact received injuries resulting in the necessity to prescribe and purchase medication. Therefore, the verdict of the jury was inconsistent and improper on its face. However, even though the substantial rights of the plaintiff were affected, because of the opportunity to correct the verdict offered by this section, which the plaintiff did not take advantage of, this error was waived. Goggins v. Harwood, 704 P.2d 1282, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 526</cite> (Wyo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The failure to raise a matter before the jury is released results in waiver of the right to complain about inconsistencies or irregularities in the verdict. Moreover, because of the opportunity to correct the verdict, the complaining party will be held to have waived the error notwithstanding its degree of irregularity or impropriety. Halliburton Co. v. Claypoole, 868 P.2d 252, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where counsel for defendant is not present when verdict is returned,
   
   but has absented himself through choice because of his individual convenience and necessity, receiving verdict in his absence and failing to resubmit the verdict to jury is not error. Pure Gas &amp; Chem. Co. v. Cook, 526 P.2d 986, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 234</cite> (Wyo. 1974).

       In an action praying for a judgment declaring that a subdivision's restrictive covenant prohibited the on-site use of a trailer for habitation during construction, allowing a partner in the law firm which was representing the plaintiffs in another case involving the subdivision's covenants to testify did not violate subsection (a)(i), as the attorney did not testify about communications from the plaintiffs to his firm or advice from his firm to the plaintiffs.

      <p>
       Even assuming that a physician’s testimony and a medical record were protected by the physician-patient privilege and that a district court erred in admitting the evidence in a termination of parental rights trial, the error was harmless because there was no reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to the parent in the absence of the evidence. The jury’s conclusion was unassailable as the additional evidence at trial was more than ample to show that the parent was unfit to have custody and control of the child.

      <p>
       When it is remembered that the prohibition against testimony respecting confidential communications is generally more strictly guarded than most other privileges, it is safe to conclude that when a defendant, entitled to the privilege of having his wife's testimony against him excluded, makes charges against his wife, testifies she accused him of having carnal knowledge of their daughter, then told him she had made a mistake, and denies the evidence given by his daughter which involved his wife, his privilege not to have her testify against him is waived, at least insofar as to the matters about which he has given testimony.

        Summary judgment. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The requirement of corroboration of evidence against a party incapable of testifying under the statute should not come into play at the summary judgment stage; it is the movant's obligation to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists, not to rely on the evidence or lack of evidence of the nonmovant. Drake v. Winkler, 838 P.2d 1177, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 141</cite> (Wyo. 1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Test in this section is one of corroboration
   
   rather than one of competency. Consolidated Constr. v. Smith, 634 P.2d 902, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 377</cite> (Wyo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       To be corroborative,
   
   as required under this section, the evidence offered must be such that it would support or tend to support, in some degree at least, some of the material issues of the claim which are testified to by the witness whose evidence is sought to be corroborated. Consolidated Constr. v. Smith, 634 P.2d 902, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 377</cite> (Wyo. 1981).

       Testimony of adverse claimant alone is not sufficient to satisfy corroboration requirement
   
   of this section. Consolidated Constr. v. Smith, 634 P.2d 902, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 377</cite> (Wyo. 1981).

        But introduction of profit sheets and testimony of record compilers
    held corroborative. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff's introduction of profit sheets and testimony of persons in charge of compiling company records is enough, under the requirement of this section, to corroborate plaintiff's claim on an oral agreement made with the deceased. Consolidated Constr. v. Smith, 634 P.2d 902, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 377</cite> (Wyo. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of corroboration is on adverse party who is testifying
   
   and not on the deceased's representatives. Consolidated Constr. v. Smith, 634 P.2d 902, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 377</cite> (Wyo. 1981).

      <p>
       A party who asserted the existence of an oral contract between two other persons to make a will, and who claimed to be a beneficiary thereunder, had the burden of proving it and, although his testimony may have been admissible under this section, it could not support a judgment without corroboration.

       The district court's erroneous conclusion that a personal representative's uncorroborated testimony should be disregarded did not require reversal absent any showing that the court's interpretation of this section prejudiced the personal representative's substantial rights.

       It would simply be unfair to permit the use of statements made by the principal shareholder and operating officer of the corporation to be used against the entity and then invoke the dead man's statute to prohibit any contrary statements that were made by that corporate officer.

     <p>
      A party may compel the
   adverse party to testify orally or by deposition as any other witness,
   and no person is disqualified as a witness in any action, civil or
   criminal, because of his interest in the same as a party or otherwise.
   Every person is a competent witness except as otherwise provided by
   law, but his interest in the action may be shown to affect the credibility
   of the witness. Any party of record in a civil action, or any person
   for whose immediate benefit the action is prosecuted or defended,
   or his assignor, officer, agent or employee or if a county or city
   is a party any officer of the county or city, may be examined upon
   the trial of any action as if under cross-examination at the instance
   of the adverse party and may be compelled to testify subject to the
   same rules for examination as any other witness. The party calling
   for the examination is not concluded thereby and may rebut the evidence
   given by counter or impeaching testimony.

       Spencer was a codefendant with appellant and the testimony he gave, if at all damaging, was as hurtful to him as it was to the appellant, and it will not be assumed he was unfriendly to himself. Furthermore, the admitted matter pleaded was also testified to by other witnesses and the same is true of all, or practically all, of Spencer's testimony. Even if there remained any doubt about this, the appellant seems to have lost its right to now complain because appellant failed to follow up its objection on that score. Appellant elected to call Spencer on its own account for similar cross-examination, and so had ample opportunity to impeach or discredit him had that been possible. Spencer also testified on direct examination in his own behalf, thus giving appellant further opportunity to subject him to additional searching cross-inquiry. The brief cross-examination attempted by appellant, however, failed to alter Spencer's testimony. The supreme court was not disposed to say in this instance that the trial court's discretion was abused. Husted v. French Creek Ranch, 79 Wyo. 307, 333 P.2d 948, <cite class="wy_code">1959 Wyo.

        Purpose. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This statute is a codification of a common law privilege and the court looks to the common law history of the privilege in determining its purpose. Curran v. Pasek, 886 P.2d 272, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 160</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary purpose of the confidential marital communication privilege is to foster marital relationships by encouraging confidential communication between spouses and this is the primary purpose the Wyoming legislature intended to further when it enacted this statute. Curran v. Pasek, 886 P.2d 272, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 160</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature codified the confidential marital communication privilege in this statute and intended to make the confidential marital communication privilege available to either spouse. Curran v. Pasek, 886 P.2d 272, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 160</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The confidential marital communication privilege is the privilege that ensures that private marital communications will remain private. Curran v. Pasek, 886 P.2d 272, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 160</cite> (Wyo. 1994).

       Witness spouse might directly invoke privilege against testifying

        But wife refusing to testify against husband not made “unavailable

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A wife's refusal to testify against her husband-defendant when called as a witness by the state in a criminal case did not make her an “unavailable witness” which would have, under Rule 804, W.R.E., justified the admission of the proffered hearsay testimony of another witness, who would have testified as to an earlier statement by the wife. Nothing in the statutes extends a privilege to the spouse when called by the defendant in a criminal case. In order for the defendant to have demonstrated “unavailability” to him, he would have had to call his wife as a witness and, if she then had continued to refuse to testify, the court could have found that she was unavailable and the hearsay testimony possibly would have been admissible. Engberg v. Meyer, 820 P.2d 70, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo. LEXIS 160</cite> (Wyo. 1991).

       Confidential communications between spouses should be protected after the death of either one of the spouses, as well as after termination of the marriage from other cause.

       That the legislature intended something more than to declare the common law exception of “cases involving corporal violence,” by this section is made plain by its use of the broader phrase “crimes against the other,” which means nothing more nor less than a “wrong” against the other.

      <p>
       The supreme court finds the rationale underlying the “intentions test” persuasive and adopts it as the rule in Wyoming. This test treats assertive conduct that is intended to communicate a confidential message from one spouse to another as a confidential marital communication. Curran v.

       The “intentions test” is a flexible analytical tool that allows a court to avoid erecting barriers to the truth while still protecting conduct that is intended to convey confidential messages between spouses.

      <p>
       Since, under this section, the wife of a defendant is a competent witness for him but not for the prosecution, it is proper for the prosecuting attorney to comment upon defendant's failure to produce her as a witness. State v. Spears, 76 Wyo. 82, 300 P.2d 551, <cite class="wy_code">1956 Wyo. LEXIS 32</cite> (Wyo. 1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, where a witness is equally available to both parties, the failure to call the witness is not the proper subject of comment; however, where the witness is the defendant's spouse and can assert the marital privilege because she is then available to the defendant but not to the government, reference to the defendant's failure to call her is not error.

    Attachment of witness who disobeys subpoena.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a witness fails
   to attend in obedience to a subpoena, the court or officer before
   whom his attendance is required may issue an attachment to the sheriff
   of the county commanding him to arrest and bring the person named
   before the court at a time and place fixed in the attachment, to give
   his testimony and answer for the contempt. If the attachment is not
   for immediately bringing the witness before the court or officer,
   a sum may be fixed in which the witness may give bond with surety
   for his appearance. The sum shall be endorsed on the back of the attachment.
   If no sum is fixed and endorsed, it shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   If the witness was not personally served, the court may order him
   to show cause why an attachment should not issue against him.

       In a medical malpractice case, it was an abuse of discretion for the district court to preclude plaintiff's expert's standard of care testimony because the defendant's doctor's infectious disease expert was allowed to give standard of care testimony while plaintiff's was not. Armstrong v. Hrabal, 2004 WY 39, 87 P.3d 1226, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 47</cite> (Wyo. 2004), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 66</cite> (Wyo. May 11, 2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice case, a court did not err by sustaining defendant doctor's objection to testimony from plaintiff's retained emergency medicine expert where plaintiff's counsel made no offer of proof, counsel did not explain to the district court his plan to pursue the standard of care in six sub-categories nor did he make an offer of proof to alert the court to how the proposed testimony would differ from earlier testimony. Further, the record did not suggest that such a plan of attack was apparent from the previous questions. Armstrong v. Hrabal, 2004 WY 39, 87 P.3d 1226, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo.

    Unpublished decision:
   </i>
   In a medical malpractice action arising from a physician's treatment of a patient's abdominal pain, the district court properly allowed the testimony of a general surgeon under Fed. R. Evid. 702 as to the standard of care; the general surgeon did not stray from his area of expertise, and Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c12a06s1-12-601" target="_self">1-12-601</a></cite> did not suggest a per se rule that only a board-certified specialist such as a gastroenterologist could provide testimony against another board-certified specialist.
   Poche v. Joubran, 389 Fed. Appx. 768, 2010 U.S. App. LEXIS 15482 (10th Cir. Wyo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical
   malpractice case, an expert's testimony regarding the standard of
   care was proper because the studies cited by the expert were relevant
   to rebut plaintiff's claim that the doctor deviated from the standard
   of care; the testimony was not that the doctor followed the alternative
   guidelines, but rather that his exercise of clinical judgment was
   consistent with the guidelines. Miller v. Beyer, 2014 WY 84, 329 P.3d 956, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 92</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice action, the court correctly gave a standard of care instruction which stated that proper technique for administering an injection is the same for doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals and that the defendant medical assistant's actions were to be measured by such standard. Beavis v. Campbell County Mem. Hosp., 2001 WY 32, 20 P.3d 508, <cite class="wy_code">2001 Wyo. LEXIS 42</cite> (Wyo. 2001), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2001 Wyo. LEXIS 48</cite> (Wyo. Apr. 17, 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a medical malpractice suit filed against a board-certified urologist, the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that in order for it to find that the doctor was negligent, it had to find by a preponderance of the evidence that he failed to act in accordance with the standard of care adhered to by the American Board of Urology; the instruction was a correct statement of the law as set forth in this section.

       In a suit challenging the legality of a bond issue, the petition presented two distinct questions, namely, (1) whether the statute under which the bonds in question were purportedly issued on its face authorized the issuance of the bonds, and (2) if the statute did authorize the issuance of the bonds, then whether the statute was unconstitutional. Where it appeared that the trial court had not decided question (1), the supreme court declined to pass upon question (2), which was reserved to it under this section. White v.

     <p>
      The supreme court may
   answer questions of law certified to it by a federal court when requested
   by the certifying court if there are involved in any proceeding before
   the federal court questions of law of this state which may be determinative
   of the cause then pending in the federal court, and as to which it
   appears to the federal court there is no controlling precedent in
   the existing decisions of the supreme court.

     <p>
      If a nonresident of the
   state or a partnership suing in its company name brings an action,
   the plaintiff must furnish sufficient security for costs approved
   by the clerk. A surety’s obligations are complete by his endorsing
   the summons or complaint. The surety is bound for the payment of all
   costs adjudged or taxed against the plaintiff in the court in which
   the action is brought or in any other court to which it may be carried,
   whether he obtains judgment or not. The nonresident plaintiff may
   deposit with the clerk of court as security for costs in the case
   such sum of money as the clerk deems sufficient for the purpose. Upon
   motion of the defendant, the court may require the deposit to be increased,
   that personal security be given or that the nonresident plaintiff
   pay all costs as fast as they accrue.

       Where borrowers, who were foreclosed on by the bank, argued that the award of contractual based attorney fees should have been limited to 15 percent of the amount of the loan but presented no citation to pertinent authority supporting their theory that the ratio of the amount of the award to the amount of the loan was the determinative factor in establishing the amount of attorney's fees to be awarded, the district court properly held that the fee requested, an award representing 194 percent of the original loan amount, was founded upon a reasonable hourly rate, and properly held that the time expended by the bank's counsel was well documented and that the time was reasonable and necessary given the defenses raised by the borrowers.

       Reasonable necessary deposition expenses made after the making of a settlement offer, such as those made for depositions relied upon by the court in granting partial summary judgment in favor of the defendant, were properly includable in reimbursable costs. However, the expense of preparing enlarged exhibits for trial was not a taxable cost. Duffy v. Brown, 708 P.2d 433, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 597</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

       The party seeking to recover attorney's fees bears the burden of demonstrating the reasonableness of the fees, with reasonableness being determined by the district court through the exercise of its sound discretion. In making that decision, the district court can rely on the itemized list and the directions provided by subsection (b) of this section. Russell v. Russell, 948 P.2d 1351, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 142</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

       Debtor's income tax refund, which included earned income credit, did not constitute “earnings” or “disposable earnings” exempt from garnishment. Trudeau v. Royal (In re Trudeau), 237 B.R. 803, 1999 Bankr. LEXIS 1075 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 1999).

     In action for amount due on note secured by mortgage on personal property, for unlawful detention of property, and foreclosure of mortgage, tried on theory that action was in replevin, defendant was entitled to recover actual damages for taking of the property, under this section, if there was no default that gave plaintiff right to possession of the property.

     Generally, there can be no recovery of attorneys' fees as damages by the prevailing party in replevin, but where there is fraud, malice, oppression or wilful wrong in the bringing of the action there is an exception to the general rule, and attorneys' fees will be allowed. Olds v. Hosford, 354 P.2d 947, <cite class="wy_code">1960 Wyo. LEXIS 65</cite> (Wyo. 1960), reh'g denied, 359 P.2d 406, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 77</cite> (Wyo. 1961).

    Garnishment of earnings for personal services.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t01c15a04s1-15-408ol1a">
       A writ of post judgment garnishment attaching earnings for personal services shall attach that portion of the defendant’s accrued and unpaid disposable earnings, specified in subsection (b) of this section. The writ shall direct the garnishee to withhold from the defendant’s accrued disposable earnings the amount attached pursuant to the writ and to pay the exempted amount to the defendant at the time his earnings are normally paid. A defendant’s disposable earnings shall remain exempt to the extent provided in subsection (b) of this section if the earnings were deposited in the defendant’s account with a financial institution within twenty (20) calendar days prior to service of a writ of garnishment against the defendant’s account with the financial institution, on the day of service of the writ or within ten (10) business days after service of the writ. This subsection does not create any obligation on the part of a financial institution to conduct an investigation of the defendant’s account or otherwise make any determination about a judgment creditor’s rights to funds in the account other than the financial institution’s obligation to file with the court and serve on the defendant an answer to the writ of garnishment. A judgment creditor may request that the court issue writs of garnishment to a defendant’s employer and the defendant’s financial institution at the same time; provided, however, that should the judgment creditor successfully garnish earnings as shown on a defendant’s pay advice, then the remaining proceeds from such pay advice deposited into an account with a financial institution shall be entirely exempt from execution, notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section. Earnings for personal services shall be deemed to accrue on the last day of the period in which they were earned or to which they relate. If the writ is served before or on the date the defendant’s earnings accrue and before the same have been paid to the defendant, the writ shall be deemed to have been served at the time the periodic earnings accrue. If more than one (1) writ is served, the writ first served shall have priority. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, an income withholding order for child support obtained pursuant to W.S. 20-6-201 through 20-6-222 shall have priority over any other garnishment.

      <li id="t01c15a04s1-15-408ol1b">
       The maximum portion of the aggregate disposable  earnings of an individual which are subject to garnishment is the  lesser of:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t01c15a04s1-15-408ol1bi">
         Twenty-five percent (25%) of defendant’s  disposable earnings for that week; or
        </li>
        <li id="t01c15a04s1-15-408ol1bii">
         The amount by which defendant’s aggregate  disposable earnings computed for that week exceeds thirty (30) times  the federal minimum hourly wage prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards  Act of 1938, 29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1), in effect at the time the earnings are payable, or,  in case of earnings for any pay period other than a week, any equivalent  multiple thereof prescribed by the administrator of the Wyoming Uniform  Consumer Credit Code in the manner provided by W.S. 40-14-505(b)(iii).
        </li>
       </ol>

      <li id="t01c15a04s1-15-408ol1c">
       Unless a garnishee is specifically informed  by affidavit of the plaintiff that the defendant has other periodic  earnings from sources other than from the garnishee and the amount  thereof, the garnishee shall treat the defendant’s earnings becoming  due from the garnishee as the defendant’s entire aggregate earnings  for the purpose of computing the sum attached by the garnishment.

      <p>
       Because a debtor's note was set-off against her obligation to a limited liability company (LLC) as allowed by
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c15a04s1-15-417" target="_self">1-15-417</a></cite>, the note was satisfied and a mortgage terminated at the time the LLC answered a creditor's writ of garnishment. As the debtor did not file her petition until after that date, the mortgage was not property of the estate, regardless of the fact that the LLC did not file a cancellation form or discharge as required under
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.34.html#t34c02s34-2-113" target="_blank">34-2-113</a></cite> and

    Failure to proceed against nonexempt garnished earnings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If a judgment creditor
   fails, within sixty (60) days from the filing of the answer of the
   garnishee, to secure a garnishee judgment and execute on garnished
   nonexempt earnings held by a garnishee pursuant to a writ of post
   judgment garnishment, the writ of garnishment which commanded the
   garnishee to hold the nonexempt portion of the defendant’s earnings
   shall be released and discharged without further order of the court.
   In that event the garnishee shall pay to the judgment debtor that
   portion of his earnings which had been held pursuant to the writ of
   garnishment.

       Under Wyoming law an order withholding income for child support has priority over any other garnishment; moreover, creditor judgment garnishments may be imposed only to the extent support garnishments do not exceed the general 25 percent limit, and accordingly, support garnishments are not to be treated as an exemption to be deducted from gross earnings in calculating disposable earnings.

      <p>
       In a case in which the ex-wife applied for a writ of garnishment against the ex-husband’s earnings for amounts owing under the property division ordered by the district court, because the child support order had be treated as a garnishment, the creditor judgment garnishments could be imposed only to the extent support garnishments did not exceed the general 25% limit; however, because the husband’s support garnishment was approximately 42% of his disposable earnings, any additional creditor garnishments were precluded, and the district court erred in enforcing the additional garnishment for the property settlement debt to the wife.

       Supreme court rejected the general interest statute as a basis for awarding interest on a contested worker’s compensation claim because the Worker’s Compensation Act did not expressly authorize an award of interest on contested claims; the general interest statute applied to judgments and decrees, not to administrative awards; and workers’ compensation awards were administrative determinations, not judgments.

        Rate of interest on unpaid judgments in child support case.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the father's income for child support purposes, simply applying the statutory rate of interest for unpaid judgments to the father's investment portfolio to estimate the father's entire income was not necessarily an accurate means to determine the father's actual income; the interest rate used should be based on some reasonable relationship to the father's actual investment income. Thus, a remand was appropriate so that the trial court could determine whether the 10 percent rate was a reasonable interest rate to estimate the father's investment income. Groenstein v. Groenstein, 2005 WY 6, 104 P.3d 765, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo. LEXIS 8</cite> (Wyo. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because child support arrears did not become a judgment by operation of law under the relevant statute, as the matter was not an action separate from the parties' divorce proceedings, but was initiated by a mother's motion to show cause that was filed in the original divorce action, the mother was not entitled to a 10 percent penalty. However, the delinquent amounts did bear interest by the relevant statute at a rate of 10 percent per year from the date of rendition. Rambo v. Rambo, 2017 WY 32, 391 P.3d 1108, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 32</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

        Divorce case. —

      </p>
      <p>
       When a Wyoming court enters a divorce decree requiring a party to pay a fixed sum of money and does not set a date for payment different than the date the decree is rendered, the judgment interest statute applies and payment of interest is required; however, when a district court enters a decree and, in the exercise of its discretion to fashion a just and equitable property division, sets a date for payment different than the date the decree is rendered or provides for payment over time, it is not required to impose interest. Therefore, in a divorce case, a district court properly exercised its discretion when it suspended payment of interest as long as a husband made annual payments of at least $15,000 toward the property allocation. Sinclair v. Sinclair, 2015 WY 120, 357 P.3d 1100, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 138</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court ordered the father to pay the mother on a date different than the judgment, and as a result, the statute did not apply, and there was no abuse of discretion when the district court did not require the father to pay interest on the equalizing sum awarded to the mother.

        Supersedeas bond did not toll accrual of postjudgment interest.
    —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly held that a supersedeas bond filed by a partner did not toll the accrual of interest on a judgment in favor of an accounting firm and that the firm's recovery was not limited to the bond amount because Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c16a01s1-16-102ol1a" target="_self">1-16-102(a)</a></cite> provided that interest accrued from the date of rendition until paid; Wyo. R. App. P. 4.02(a) indicated that the bond should be conditioned to account for interest and damages for delay.

       As used in this section “judgment by operation  of law” means a periodic payment or installment for child support  or maintenance which is unpaid on the date due and which has become  a judgment by operation of law pursuant to W.S. 14-2-204.

       Any judgment by operation of law which  is not paid within thirty-two (32) calendar days from the date the  judgment by operation of law arises is subject to an automatic late  payment penalty in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount  of the judgment by operation of law.

       In order to recover penalties assessed  under subsection (b) of this section, the obligee shall file with  the clerk of court a sworn affidavit setting forth the payment history  resulting in assessment of any penalty and a computation of all penalties  claimed to be due and owing. It shall not be the responsibility of  the clerk to compute the amount of the penalties due and owing. If  the obligor disputes the payment history or penalty computation as  stated in the obligee’s sworn affidavit, the obligor shall file with  the clerk of court a written request for a hearing within ten (10)  days after seizure of his property under execution.

      <p>
       Because child support arrears did not become a judgment by operation of law under the relevant statute, as the matter was not an action separate from the parties' divorce proceedings, but was initiated by a mother's motion to show cause that was filed in the original divorce action, the mother was not entitled to a 10 percent penalty. However, the delinquent amounts did bear interest by the relevant statute at a rate of 10 percent per year from the date of rendition. Rambo v.

       Rendition of a judgment is the judicial act of the court in pronouncing the sentence of the law on the facts in controversy, as distinguished from entry, which is the clerical act of spreading the judgment on the record.

       The trial court's findings that the judgment in favor of lienor was rendered on August 9, 1972, and that rendition is the judicial act of the court in pronouncing the sentence of the law on the facts in controversy, as distinguished from entry, which is the clerical act of the court of spreading the judgment on the record, was not clearly erroneous.

       Bill of exceptions
   
   is not merely a statement of exceptions, but includes a statement clearly showing objection, with facts and circumstances on which it is founded, authenticated by trial judge, and brings into record matter which otherwise would not be regularly shown thereby.

       Where a judgment creditor sought a declaration that its judgment had priority, the fact that the judgment was unsigned did not necessarily render it void. Although the better practice would be that only signed judgments be entered, where an unsigned judgment is entered, the totality of the circumstances must be evaluated to determine its effectiveness.

     <p>
      When a judgment, including judgments rendered by a circuit court, a transcript of which has been filed in the district court for execution, becomes dormant, it may be revived by the allowance of the court of a motion for revival or by a conditional order of the court that the action be revived. If the order of revival is made by consent of the parties, the action shall be revived. If the order is not made by consent, the order shall be served on the adverse party. When either party to the dormant judgment, his agent or attorney, makes affidavit showing that the adverse party is a nonresident of the state and that the judgment remains unsatisfied in whole or in part and the amount owing thereon, service may be made by publication as in other cases. If sufficient cause is not shown to the contrary, the judgment shall stand revived for the amount which the court finds to be due and unsatisfied thereon. The lien of the judgment for the amount due shall be revived and shall operate from the time of the entry of the conditional order or the filing of the motion.

      <p>
       Judgment creditors already had title to a parcel of land by virtue of a prior recorded warranty deed and their ownership interest was not affected by their execution against this land. The redemptioner, however, had paid something to redeem this land, as to which he had no right of redemption and to which the court subsequently quieted title in the judgment creditors. Under the circumstances, to refuse to permit the complaint to be amended so that the redemptioner could claim the amount paid for the parcel which he did not receive constituted an abuse of discretion.

       To the extent defendant officials exceeded the scope of a writ by shipping the horses at issue to South Carolina, absolute immunity did not apply, and although Wyoming law allowed for a private sale, they were still required to retain possession (actual or constructive) until a court authorized such a sale for good cause after due notice given to the adverse party; nevertheless, there was no constitutional violation stemming from the transfer because the court ultimately held the hearing and ordered the return of all horses not subject to execution (plaintiffs received all the process they were due).

       Where defendant was large stockholder in elevator company, and property of that company was about to be seized and sold by person holding judgment against them and defendant induced plaintiffs to execute stay bond under agreement to protect them, holding harmless and signing of stay bond constituted “confession of judgment” from date thereof under this section, and signing of stay bond constituted valid consideration for promise to hold signers' harmless.

      <p>
       It is apparent that the automatic stay does not operate to stop a creditor from maintaining or continuing the perfection of its security interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy case; however, under Wyoming law, a creditor must execute on its lien within one year of the date the judgment is rendered to maintain its lien. Execution of a judgment is considered a violation of the automatic stay, and, therefore, the court determined that the one-year period is stayed during the period of the automatic stay for execution of a judgment lien.

Thus, even if their lien had expired, the judgment creditors could still execute on the debtor's property and a conveyance of the property by the debtor was fraudulent. Dev-Tech Corp. v.

      A judgment of the supreme

   be filed with the county clerk, it shall be recorded in the real estate
   records. Goods and chattels of the debtor are bound from the time
   they are seized in execution. The lien of a judgment of the district
   court which is appealed to the supreme court shall not be divested
   or vacated, but shall continue until the final determination of the
   action in the supreme court.

        Unpublished decision:

       Because defendant officers seized the horses at plaintiffs'
   ranch pursuant to a facially valid writ of execution, they were absolutely immune from suit; it followed, then, that to the extent the officials were shielded by absolute quasi-judicial immunity, plaintiffs'
   conspiracy claim failed.

       Execution sales are not for sale of any specified property.

       Rather, such sales are only for recovery of a designated sum of money.

      <p>
       Hence, there needs to be a reasonable degree of accuracy in designating the sum of money to be recovered
   
   for a sale to be considered valid. Chittim v. Armco Steel Corp., 407 P.2d 1015, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo. LEXIS 170</cite> (Wyo. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the money specified in the writ of execution is erroneously stated, it cannot be considered a valid writ
   
   for two reasons. In the first place, it is likely to result in the sale of more of the judgment debtor's property than sound judgment would dictate. In the second place, it prevents the judgment debtor from protecting his property by payment of the correct amount for redemption. Any levy and sale under execution, after a lawful tender of the correct amount due, would be illegal. Chittim v. Armco Steel Corp., 407 P.2d 1015, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo.

       There can be no writ of execution properly issued to enforce a conditional judgment. Where property is sold pursuant to a writ of execution issued on such a nonexistent judgment, the sale is not conducted in conformity with the Code of Civil Procedure, as required by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c17a03s1-17-321" target="_self">1-17-321</a></cite>, and should not have to be confirmed by the district court. 2-2-H Ranch Co. v.

     <p>
      A master commissioner
   or special master who sells real property has the same power to administer
   oaths as the sheriff. A sheriff may act as a master commissioner and,
   upon notice and for reasonable compensation to be paid by the master
   commissioner out of his fees, may attend and make sale for any commissioner
   who, by reason of sickness is unable to attend. Sales made by a master
   shall conform in all respects to the laws regulating sales of lands
   upon execution.

      <p>
       It is apparent that the automatic stay does not operate to stop a creditor from maintaining or continuing the perfection of its security interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy case; however, under Wyoming law, a creditor must execute on its lien within one year of the date the judgment is rendered to maintain its lien. Execution of a judgment is considered a violation of the automatic stay, and, therefore, the court determined that the one-year period is stayed during the period of the automatic stay for execution of a judgment lien.

   After entering judgment for plaintiff, pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c17a04s1-17-401" target="_self">1-17-401</a></cite>, the district court assigned to plaintiff defendants'
   interest in a lawsuit they had filed in Florida; this was an abuse of discretion due to the extraordinary difficulty in estimating the value of a chose in action, and the fact that plaintiff had no intention of actually litigating the suit. The court could have subjected the chose to an execution sale, imposed an equitable lien on any proceeds from the suit, or selected an alternative remedy; but simply granting plaintiff direct ownership of defendants'
   chose was impermissible.

     <p>
      When real property is
   sold by virtue of an execution, order of sale, decree of foreclosure
   or foreclosure by advertisement and sale, the sheriff or other officer,
   instead of executing a deed to the premises sold, shall give to the
   purchaser of the lands a certificate in writing describing the property
   purchased and the sum paid therefor, or if purchased by the plaintiff
   in execution or by the mortgagee, the amount of his bid. The certificate
   shall state that the purchaser is entitled to a deed for the property
   at the expiration of the period of redemption, unless the property
   is redeemed prior to that date as provided by law. The sheriff or
   other officer shall record in the office of the recorder of the county
   a duplicate of the certificate, signed and acknowledged by him, and
   the certificate or a certified copy thereof is admissible as evidence

       Except as provided with respect to agricultural real estate, it is lawful for any person, his heirs, executors, administrators, assigns or guarantors whose real property has been sold by virtue of an execution, decree of foreclosure, or foreclosure by advertisement and sale within three (3) months from the date of sale, to redeem the real estate by paying to the purchaser, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, or to the sheriff or other officer who sold the property, for the benefit of the purchaser, the amount of the purchase price or the amount given or bid if purchased by the execution creditor or by the mortgagee under a mortgage, together with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum from the date of sale plus the amount of any assessments or taxes and the amount due on any prior lien which the purchaser paid after the purchase, with interest. On payment of this amount the sale and certificate granted are void and the sheriff or other officer shall issue a certificate of redemption.

       In the case of any mortgage upon one (1)  or more parcels of real estate any or all of which were agricultural  real estate on the date of execution of the mortgage as stated in  the mortgage, the period within which the owner, his heirs, executors,  administrators, assigns or guarantors may redeem the premises sold  is twelve (12) months from the date of the sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c18s1-18-103ol1c">
       The term “agricultural real estate” means any single parcel of land in excess of eighty (80) acres lying outside the exterior boundaries of any incorporated city, town or recorded subdivision or any property that is used substantially for agricultural purposes, which, if combined with other property in the mortgage that is used substantially for agricultural purposes, equals eighty (80) acres or more in aggregate. If the mortgage recites that the real estate involved is agricultural real estate, it is presumed the parties to the mortgage, their heirs, executors, administrators, assigns, guarantors or successors in interest have agreed to and are bound by all the provisions of law relative to the twelve (12) month right of redemption provided in subsection (b) of this section.

      <p>
       When property which is held in a partnership's name is sold at a foreclosure sale, the partnership, not an individual partner, is the “person whose real estate has been sold.” Under the plain language of this section, only a judgment creditor of the partnership can redeem the property.

      </p>
      <p>
       Although an individual purchases a mortgage because he thinks it will give him a right to be in the building as mortgagee, he has no such right. The mortgage simply creates a lien on the land, and title to the mortgaged property does not pass to him as mortgagee even on default, but passes only on sale by foreclosure. International Distress Signals v. McDowell, 519 P.2d 224, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 187</cite> (Wyo. 1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the mortgage provision, entitling the mortgagee to rents and profits when the right of foreclosure accrued, was not self-executing, the mortgagee's right to receive rents and profits from the mortgaged property prior to taking possession would not accrue until it took some affirmative action to exercise that right.

       The exemption failed under this section where debtor occupied a mobile home on a parcel of land contiguous to the claimed parcels because the debtor must occupy the homestead at the time the bankruptcy case is filed and contiguousness does not equate with occupancy.

       Since it must be regarded as the settled law of Wyoming, under the rule of stare decisis, that a homestead right can be acquired upon an undivided interest in land and that it is immaterial in whom the legal title is vested, it necessarily follows that the right of homestead will attach to real estate held by a husband and wife as tenants by the entirety and occupied by them as a residence.

       Where action brought before a justice should have been dismissed for want of jurisdiction and was, on motion of defendants, certified to district court, apparently on supposition that it was governed by this section, whereupon defendants appeared in district court, and successfully resisted plaintiff's motion to remand, court obtained jurisdiction of their persons, which could not be affected by the fact that, before going to trial, they moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, and district court had jurisdiction of the action, the subject matter thereof being within its original jurisdiction.

       Small claims action filed in a circuit court by a homeowners' association to collect allegedly overdue association dues should have been certified to the district court because the case encompassed questions concerning the validity of restrictive covenants that would affect homeowners' title.

   before a judge may be submitted to the arbitration of three (3) men
   by agreement of the parties. Each party shall select one (1) arbitrator
   and the two (2) so selected shall choose the third. They shall be
   sworn by the judge and proceed in a summary manner to hear the cause.
   Any of the arbitrators may administer oaths, issue subpoenas for witnesses
   and compel their attendance, and punish for contempt. They shall make
   their awards in writing, any two (2) concurring being the award of
   all. The award shall be reported to the judge who shall enter judgment
   accordingly. The judgment is final unless it is made to appear to
   the judge within ten (10) days after the entry of judgment that the
   award was obtained by fraud, corruption or any undue means, in which
   case the judge shall set aside the award and the case shall stand
   for trial as though no award had been made.

       Trial court erred in ruling that the public defender had to accept all appointments to serve as counsel for indigent defendants unless and until the appointing court ruled otherwise, and therefore its order holding the state public defender in contempt for declining two appointments based on the unavailability of counsel was reversed, because this section afforded the public defender discretion to decline an appointment or appointments. The court further held that in exercising that discretion, there was no requirement, statutory or otherwise, that the public defender show an individualized injury in fact or meet the Strickland post-conviction showing of prejudice.

        Purpose of section. —

      <p>
       This section is primarily intended to give summary restitution of properties unlawfully withheld. Hurst v. Davis, 386 P.2d 943, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal object of the statutory proceeding is to furnish a speedy remedy for recovery of possession against tenants holding over their term and to save landlords from the need to resort to a cumbersome, dilatory, and expensive suit in ejectment. Knight v. Boner, 459 P.2d 205, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 162</cite> (Wyo. 1969).

       Specific relation between
    this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c21a10s1-21-1002" target="_self">1-21-1002</a></cite>
   
   is not altogether clear insofar
   as cases of unlawful detainer are concerned. The last sentence of
   § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c21a10s1-21-1002" target="_self">1-21-1002</a></cite> has been construed as referring to the provisions of
   this section, so it may be that, unless reference is made only to
   forcible entry and detainer, this section might embrace cases of unlawful
   detainer not mentioned in
   § 1-21-1002.Ferguson v. Haygood, 67 Wyo. 422, 225 P.2d 336, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1950).

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A civil proceeding for forcible entry and detainer or unlawful detainer being statutory and summary in nature, statute conferring jurisdiction must be at least substantially complied with in the method of procedure prescribed by it or the jurisdiction will fail to attach and the proceeding will be coram non judice and void. White v. Veitch, 27 Wyo. 401, 197 P. 983, <cite class="wy_code">1921 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 1921).

        Complaint essential to jurisdiction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In forcible entry and detainer cases, the filing of a complaint describing the property is essential to jurisdiction. White v. Veitch, 27 Wyo. 401, 197 P. 983, <cite class="wy_code">1921 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where justice court was without jurisdiction in an action of forcible entry and detainer because of lack of essential allegations in the complaint, objection of lack of jurisdiction was not waived by failing to raise it in the justice court, nor could an amended complaint filed in the district court cure such jurisdictional defect. White v. Veitch, 27 Wyo. 401, 197 P. 983, <cite class="wy_code">1921 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 1921).

      <p>
       Justice court held without jurisdiction in forcible entry and detainer action to restore to purchaser at mortgage foreclosure sale premises occupied by debtor after the latter filed petition under section in Bankruptcy Act regarding agricultural compositions and extensions, since it is a proceeding for recovering possession of land. In re Dickinson, 9 F. Supp. 227, 1934 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1197 (D. Wyo. 1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable defenses are not available
   
   in cases of unlawful detainer under this section and § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c21a10s1-21-1002" target="_self">1-21-1002</a></cite>.Ferguson v. Haygood, 67 Wyo. 422, 225 P.2d 336, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither the court of the justice of the peace nor the action of unlawful detainer is designed to try equitable defenses. Knight v. Boner, 459 P.2d 205, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 162</cite> (Wyo. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       The possessory action of forcible entry and detainer is not to be converted into an action of ejectment where the question of legal and equitable titles can be tried or to an action seeking equitable relief. That is not to say, of course, that a determination in the possessory action precludes an action in the proper forum to enforce equitable rights. Knight v. Boner, 459 P.2d 205, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 162</cite> (Wyo. 1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A setoff or counterclaim in a detainer action is not permissible.
   
   Hurst v. Davis, 386 P.2d 943, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The efficacy of this section as a summary remedy giving restitution for nonpayment of rent is lessened if not destroyed if a setoff or counterclaim is permitted to be interposed. Hurst v. Davis, 386 P.2d 943, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for not allowing setoffs or counterclaims in a detainer action is that since the action is a summary proceeding designed especially for the purpose of a speedy means of recovering possession of real property, tenants withholding the premises in violation of the covenants of their lease cannot through means of a cross-complaint or counterclaim frustrate the extraordinary remedy provided by this section. Hurst v. Davis, 386 P.2d 943, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. 1963).

       Forcible entry and detainer is a purely statutory remedy, summary in character and in derogation of the common law. Steffens v. Smith, 477 P.2d 119, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 207</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       Proceedings under forcible entry and detainer may be had only in cases enumerated

      <p>
       Hence, where a seller sought to recover realty from a buyer to whom he had sold the realty under a contract for deed and whom he had put in possession and buyer had defaulted in the terms of the contract, the case was not one of those specific examples set forth in this section, and the justice of the peace had no jurisdiction to bring an action under this section.

       The provision which requires rendering a judgment for the amount of rent found due only applies when the amount of rent due is within the jurisdictional limitation of the justice of the peace to render judgment therefor.

      </p>
      <p>
       If the direction to render a judgment for the amount of rent due is to be construed as mandatory in every case, even when that amount is in excess of the court's constitutional jurisdiction, then the statutory requirement for such a judgment would clearly be unconstitutional and void, but a mere finding of the amount of rent due, even though that amount be in excess of the jurisdictional judgment limitation, would not be constitutionally violative. Hurst v. Davis, 386 P.2d 943, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Should the amount of rent found due exceed the jurisdictional limitation of the justice of the peace, no judgment for rent would be rendered, but the finding of amount of rent due and the terms of the parties' agreement would be retained, since this insures that a successful plaintiff will receive full monetary protection during pendency of an appeal.

       There was no basis for granting renewed motions filed by an LLC that owned real property and an LLC that managed the property, seeking judgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, a new trial or remittitur of a jury verdict awarding a tenant who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and was found to be 10% at fault for her injury $3 million in compensatory damages, $3 million in punitive damages against the LLC that owned the property, and $22.5 million against the LLC that managed the property; the court properly instructed the jury that the Wyoming Residential Rental Property Act, Wyo.

       Wyoming statute allowed costs, damages and affirmative relief, including judicial termination of rental agreement for failure to maintain heating, but Wyoming statute further provides that an owner is not liable for claims for mental suffering or anguish. Accordingly, Wyoming does not provide for civil penalties that would have put an apartment management company on notice that failure to maintain the furnaces could subject it to punitive damages of the magnitude awarded by the jury.

       Wyoming statute allowed costs, damages and affirmative relief, including judicial termination of rental agreement for failure to maintain heating, but Wyoming statute further provides that an owner is not liable for claims for mental suffering or anguish. Accordingly, Wyoming does not provide for civil penalties that would have put an apartment management company on notice that failure to maintain the furnaces could subject it to punitive damages of the magnitude awarded by the jury.

       Abandonment imparts any conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child and involves more than mere temporary absence or temporary neglect of parental duty.

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The putative father had standing to contest the adoption and had established a claim to paternity as required by § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c22a01s1-22-108" target="_self">1-22-108</a></cite>(c)(i), although he failed to establish his paternity within three years of the child's birth, as required by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.14.html#t14c02a01s14-2-105" target="_blank">14-2-105</a></cite>. The explicit standing requirement of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c22a01s1-22-108" target="_self">1-22-108</a></cite> must control in the adoption context. Moreover, when the legislature defined “putative father” to include an alleged father “whether or not the paternity rights and obligations of the father have been judicially determined” (subsection (a)(iv)), it clearly indicated that an official declaration of paternity was not relevant to contested adoption cases.

       The Supreme Court declined to apply the doctrine of equitable adoption to affect the distribution of a testate estate, as adoption and probate are both statutory procedures, with formalities designed to ensure certainty, and where neither the applicable statutes nor the last will and testament were ambiguous, neither legislative intent nor testamentary intent depended upon a resort to equity.

       Adoption statutes are strictly construed when the proceeding is against a nonconsenting parent, and every reasonable intendment is made in favor of that parent's claims; such strict construction is mandated by the fact that parental rights are fundamental rights.

      <p>
       District court properly treated subsection (c) as a complete and independent adoption statute,
   
   regardless of whether § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c22a01s1-22-110" target="_self">1-22-110</a></cite> might also apply. Section <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c22a01s1-22-110" target="_self">1-22-110</a></cite> provides a set of circumstances, such as the nonconsenting party's abuse, abandonment or failure to support the child, under which an adoption is justified no matter who the nonconsenting party is. But the more liberal adoption test of this section applies to only those adoptions contested by putative fathers who have already shown their lack of concern for their children by failing to establish legal paternity. In re Adoption of GSD, 716 P.2d 984, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 521</cite> (Wyo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Putative father had standing
    to contest the adoption
   
   and had established a claim to
   paternity as required by subsection (c)(i), although he failed to
   establish his paternity within three years of the child's birth, as
   required by former § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.14.html#t14c02a01s14-2-105" target="_blank">14-2-105</a></cite>. The explicit standing requirement of
   this section must control in the adoption context. Moreover, when
   the legislature defined “putative father” to include an alleged father
   “whether or not the paternity rights and obligations of the father
   have been judicially determined” (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c22a01s1-22-101ol1aiv" target="_self">1-22-101(a)(iv)</a></cite>), it clearly indicated that an official declaration of
   paternity was not relevant to contested adoption cases.

       Where evidence is uncontradicted that when father first learned that mother was pregnant with his child, he agreed she should not get an abortion, and he provided financial support and prenatal care while she lived with him, putative father showed “interest in and responsibility for” child pursuant to subsection (c)(ii). In a contested adoption case, the test is not what the father could or should have done, but what he did do within 30 days after he received notice of the pending birth of his child. In re Adoption of BBC, 831 P.2d 197, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 51</cite> (Wyo. 1992), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 59</cite> (Wyo. May 8, 1992).

      <p>
       The putative father expressed an interest in the child within the 30-day period by visiting the child immediately after birth, by offering his support immediately after the birth, and by bringing substantial gifts for the child, including clothing, at the initial visit. In re Adoption of GSD, 716 P.2d 984, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 521</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

      <p>
       The court did not abuse its discretion when it found a good relationship between the child and the adopting stepfather and when it found that the putative father had willfully abandoned the child by not visiting for 20 months prior to the trial although he knew the location of the child at all times, by never trying to establish his paternity through legal process, and by never attempting to be a father to the child in any substantial way; therefore, the court correctly held that the putative father had no valid objections to the adoption.

       Regardless of the errors or mistakes the Wyoming Department of Family Services might have made in the juvenile proceeding, the reality was that the mother admitted the neglect allegations and the district court entered an order of final disposition, concluding that the child was a neglected child; the mother did not object to, or appeal from, that final disposition order finding her guilty of neglect. Furthermore, the mother could not challenge the validity of the neglect order in the adoption proceeding; thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the mother's consent to the child's adoption was not required under subsection (a)(vii) of this section because the mother had been adjudged guilty of neglecting the child.

       District court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the mother's consent to the child's adoption was not required under subsection (a)(v) of this section because the mother willfully allowed the child to remain in the custody of the Wyoming Department of Family Services (DFS) for the year immediately preceding the filing of the adoption petition without substantially contributing to his support, and physical placement of the child with his grandfather would not have removed the child from DFS's legal custody.

        Construction of former § 1-710.2. —

      </p>
      <p>
       This section is poorly written and ungrammatical. In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is grammatically incorrect when subsection (c) is read with the opening phrase of the statute, thus: “An adoption may be decreed without the written consent of the parent or parents of the child sought to be adopted where said nonconsenting mother or father: (c) who [sic] has willfully abandoned such child.” In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The series of alternatives was interrupted by the absence of the word “or” between subsections (c) and (d) and so joinder of (c) and (d) must have been intended. In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the word “or” is absent, subsections (c) and (d) are not separate and not alternatives. In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The supreme court could not say that there is clerical error in omission of “or” at the end of subsection (c). In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The introductory language of this section and subsection (d) would make sense and avoid a seeming lack of connection if the words were rearranged as follows: place the words “has not contributed to the support of said child during a period of one (1) year immediately prior to the filing of the petition for adoption” at the beginning of the subsection, followed by “if it is proven to the satisfaction of the court that said father or mother, if able, or.” In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the word “who” was left out, and it does serve no useful purpose, subsection (c) would be able to stand alone. In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>

       Subsections (a), (b) and (e) can be read separately with the opening of the section. In re Adoption of Voss, 550 P.2d 481, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (c) and (d) must be read and considered together since the conjunctive “or” does not appear following (c) as it does following each of the other conditions which must exist in the alternative before a parent loses his rights of parenthood.

        Natural grandparent not entitled to visit child. —

      <p>
       Any agreement, whether it was oral or in writing or whether or not it was included within the terms of an adoption decree, would not give a natural grandparent a right to visitation with the child. To the extent the existence of any such agreement permitting her to visit with the child could be proved, it would be void and unenforceable as violative of public policy. In re Adoption of RDS, 787 P.2d 968, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the legislature did not provide that paternal grandparent visitation rights survived the adoption of their grandchild by the child's maternal grandparents, such visitation rights were limited and terminable without notice, and therefore did not rise to the magnitude of constitutionally protected liberty interests. The adoption statutes extinguished all legal relationships between the adopted child and his biological family. Hede v. Gilstrap, 2005 WY 24, 107 P.3d 158, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo.

       </p>
       <p>
        As originally enacted, C.L. 1876, ch. 57, consisted of 3 sections. Section 1 contained substantially the same provisions as the first five paragraphs of this section; § 2 related to contracts for sales of goods for more than $50.00 and was repealed by § 77, ch. 98, Laws 1917, which act adopted the former Uniform Sales Act; § 3 was substantially the same as paragraph (vi) of this section; and § 4 provided that the act was not applicable to transactions happening prior to its passage.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no subsection (b) in this section as it appears in the printed acts.

         Legislative purpose. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of frauds is an expression of fixed legislative policy of the state and is absolutely necessary to preserve the title to real property from the chances, the uncertainty, and the fraud attending the admission of parol testimony. Fowler v. Fowler, 933 P.2d 502, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 44</cite> (Wyo. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of frauds was enacted to prevent fraud, not to aid it,
   
   and should receive a reasonable interpretation with that end in view. Wallis v. Bosler, 70 Wyo. 129, 246 P.2d 771, <cite class="wy_code">1952 Wyo. LEXIS 24</cite> (Wyo. 1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         And should be liberally construed. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        This statute is to be liberally construed. Mead v. Leo Sheep Co., 32 Wyo. 313, 232 P. 511, <cite class="wy_code">1925 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        With some exceptions, equity as well as law is bound
   
   by the statute of frauds. Crosby v. Estate of Strahan, 78 Wyo. 302, 324 P.2d 492, <cite class="wy_code">1958 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite> (Wyo. 1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equitable exceptions to the statute of frauds exist, but the supreme court restricts, rather than expands, those exceptions, even when a hardship will occur. Fowler v. Fowler, 933 P.2d 502, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 44</cite> (Wyo. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        It may be necessary for court to uphold oral agreements
   
   to accomplish the purpose of the statute of frauds. Remilong v. Crolla, 576 P.2d 461, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 277</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
       </p>

        <b>
         Certain matters immaterial if statute satisfied. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is a valid and enforceable contract entered into in compliance with the statute of frauds, part performance is immaterial, as is any subsequent ratification. Part performance only becomes a significant issue when a contract fails to satisfy the statute of frauds. Reed v. Wadsworth, 553 P.2d 1024, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 209</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

         Effect of voidable contract in tort action. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In the setting of tortious interference with a contract, it is not necessarily fatal to a cause of action that an underlying contract may be voidable by reason of this section. Kvenild v. Taylor, 594 P.2d 972, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 410</cite> (Wyo. 1979).

        In applying the statute of frauds, the courts generally draw a clear distinction between oral contracts for the sale, transfer or creation of an interest in real property and a partnership or joint adventure to acquire, sell and deal in real estate. The basis of the distinction is that an oral agreement between parties to acquire, sell or otherwise deal in real estate and to share in the speculative profits is an agreement concerning personal, not real, property; the real property acquired and dealt in is regarded as personal property among the partners to the speculative adventure and hence not within the statute of frauds.

        Record contained sufficient evidence that created genuine issues of material fact as to the application of the statute of frauds, and the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to a seller in a suit brought by land purchasers for the enforcement of a lease with an option to purchase agreement where the purchasers claimed that the agreement had been orally modified by the seller; conduct of the purchasers supported their claim where, inter alia, they had continued to make all of their monthly payments under the agreement.

         What constitutes part performance. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        A part performance to take an oral agreement to convey real estate out of the statute of frauds must be substantial and of such a nature that the refusal to enforce the agreement would result not merely in the denial of the right which the agreement was intended to confer but an unjust and unconscionable injury. Crosby v. Estate of Strahan, 78 Wyo. 302, 324 P.2d 492, <cite class="wy_code">1958 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite> (Wyo. 1958); Allen v. Allen, 550 P.2d 1137, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo.

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the common law exception to the statute of frauds of substantial performance is a version of equitable estoppel, the court will look to the relations of the parties to a parol agreement, the nature of the parol agreement, and the relative benefit and detriment derived by the parties in determining whether substantial performance removes the agreement from the statute of frauds. Empfield v. Kimbrough, 900 P.2d 1153, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 139</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

        Where purchaser takes possession under an oral contract and pays all or a part of the agreed price, it is sufficient to take the transaction out of the provisions of this section. Johnson v. Maki, 45 Wyo. 113, 16 P.2d 46, <cite class="wy_code">1932 Wyo. LEXIS 54</cite> (Wyo. 1932).

       Certificates of deposit were cashed for holder who was engaged in gambling by the keeper of the gambling room, at time when holder was not indebted for past losses, and the full amount of the certificates was paid him, but most of it was thereafter lost in gambling. It was held that transfer of the certificates was not “for the consideration of money won” from the holder, so as to be void. Kinney v. Hynds, 7 Wyo. 22, 49 P. 403, <cite class="wy_code">1897 Wyo.

     This section held to be the only provision applicable to cities and towns. Newcastle v. Toomey, 78 Wyo. 432, 329 P.2d 264, <cite class="wy_code">1958 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1958).

      Mandatory provisions, applicability. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Insofar as statutes governing condemnation by cities of first class were inapplicable to complaining parties, and insofar as failure to comply therewith could not prejudice them, statutes could not be consider mandatory as to them. Hirt v. Casper, 56 Wyo. 57, 103 P.2d 394, <cite class="wy_code">1940 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo. 1940).

      Demand of jury trial. —

    </p>
    <p>
     Entry of final order by court in condemnation by a city for a water system, before the time provided by former §§ 1-770, 1-774 and 1-777 does not prejudice right of landowners to demand a jury trial, within the time allowed by the statute therefor. City of Cheyenne v. Edwards, 22 Wyo. 401, 143 P. 356, <cite class="wy_code">1914 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1914).

    <p>
     <b>
      Power of eminent domain cannot be exercised by resolution or
    ordinance. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no statutory provision which grants to any city or town any power to exercise the power of eminent domain by resolution or ordinance adopted by a town or city council. Newcastle v. Toomey, 78 Wyo. 432, 329 P.2d 264, <cite class="wy_code">1958 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1958).

    <p>
     <b>
      Ratification by council. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Fact that city council did not adopt formal resolution authorizing city attorney to institute condemnation proceedings is not fatal where, after proceedings were instituted, council ratified what had been done. Hirt v. Casper, 56 Wyo. 57, 103 P.2d 394, <cite class="wy_code">1940 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo. 1940).

     <b>
      Abutting property, condemnation. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Statutes authorizing condemnation by cities of first class apply both to property physically taken and to abutting property indirectly damaged even though some provisions relating to actual taking cannot be carried out. Hirt v. Casper, 56 Wyo. 57, 103 P.2d 394, <cite class="wy_code">1940 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo. 1940).

    </p>

     The provisions of this section apply to City of Cheyenne to authorize it to condemn land to establish city waterworks. Edwards v. Cheyenne, 19 Wyo. 110, 114 P. 677, <cite class="wy_code">1911 Wyo. LEXIS 9</cite> (Wyo. 1911), reh'g denied, 19 Wyo. 110, 122 P. 900, <cite class="wy_code">1912 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 1912).

     <b>
      Petition to change water permit. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     A petition to change water permits from a beneficial to a preferred use for municipal purposes, even if considered as a petition for condemnation, cannot be basis for taking from holders of such permits anything more than their claims and settling rights injuriously affected by the change of use. Town of Newcastle v. Smith, 28 Wyo. 371, 205 P. 302, <cite class="wy_code">1922 Wyo. LEXIS 29</cite> (Wyo. 1922).

      Limitation of act. —

    </p>
    <p>
     This section does not empower city to purchase a gas plant by issuance of bonds. Lakota Oil &amp; Gas Co. v. Casper, 57 Wyo. 329, 116 P.2d 861, <cite class="wy_code">1941 Wyo. LEXIS 34</cite> (Wyo. 1941).
    </p>
    <p>
     Light plants may be acquired by eminent domain, but bonds must be within debt limitation fixed by statute and authority for issuance must be voted by the people. Whipps v. Greybull, 56 Wyo. 355, 109 P.2d 805, <cite class="wy_code">1941 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 1941).

     Chapter 78, Laws 1933 (former §§ 1-747 to 1-753), and Revised Statutes 1931, § 22-1601 et seq. (former § 15-530), dealing with same subject matter, should be construed together. Jensen v. Afton, 59 Wyo. 500, 143 P.2d 190, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

      Utility financing. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Power to purchase public utility plant accorded cities and towns by ch. 78, Laws 1933 (former §§ 1-747 to 1-753), does not imply a power also to finance that purchase in a manner which legislature has persistently refused to recognize. Jensen v. Afton, 59 Wyo. 500, 143 P.2d 190, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 26</cite> (Wyo. 1943).

       District court did not err in finding the condemnor board of county commissioners met all the requirements of the eminent domain statutes in seeking to condemn part of the condemnees' land in connection with a water system for a reservoir's recreational facilities where the board presented evidence that: 1) the project was in the public interest and necessary; 2) the water benefited many uses in an area accessed by members of the general public and private individuals; 3) although there might be ways to relocate the water system, at that time its use in place was compatible with the greatest public good; and 4) the condemnees failed to show bad faith or abuse of discretion on the part of the board.

       Railroad offered sufficient evidence that a 50-foot tract of land was needed to provide slope support for a railroad track and to allow construction of a fire break and access road, so the public necessity requirement for condemnation under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c26a05s1-26-504ol1a" target="_self">1-26-504(a)</a></cite> was satisfied. The evidence showed that the soils around the property were unstable and prone to failure and that the property was needed to achieve the recommended minimum standard for railroad slopes.

      When a person possessing
   the power of condemnation takes possession of or damages land in which

   land, due to activities on adjoining land without the authorization
   of the owner of the land or before filing an action of condemnation,

   damages for the taking or damage and shall be granted litigation expenses
   if damages are awarded to the owner.

        Action one for inverse condemnation.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly emphasized that in the absence of eminent domain proceedings the action was an inverse condemnation case because eminent domain proceedings were not used by a county for the expansion of a road; according to the county, it did not need to use eminent domain proceedings because it already had an easement for the project. Byrnes v. Johnson Cty. Comm'rs, 2020 WY 6, 455 P.3d 693, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 6</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

        Substantial diminishment of property's value.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly entered a judgment as a matter of law that a property owner failed to establish a taking and failed to provide proof of damages because the evidence presented did not prove a “substantial diminishment” of the property’s value; a witness’s testimony did not establish a value of the owner’s property as a whole, and the value of the property needed to be established in order to determine whether the impairment of the driveways substantially diminished that value. Byrnes v. Johnson Cty. Comm'rs, 2020 WY 6, 455 P.3d 693, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 6</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

        Value of property.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly entered a judgment as a matter of law on the ground that no jury would be able to determine the before and after value of property based on the evidence presented because the estimated costs for changes to the property did not equate to “fair market value"; the estimated costs did not reflect the value of an arms-length transaction for the sale of the property, did not establish the lack of a market for the property, and did not establish comparable sales. Byrnes v. Johnson Cty. Comm'rs, 2020 WY 6, 455 P.3d 693, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 6</cite> (Wyo. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly entered a judgment as a matter of law because the value of the property taken was not established; the only values presented were the value of the property after the road expansion, estimated costs of amending the driveway approaches, and an overall estimate of all costs, and under either of the two measures of damages in a partial takings case, the jury would not have been able to reach a conclusion based on the limited evidence presented. Byrnes v. Johnson Cty. Comm'rs, 2020 WY 6, 455 P.3d 693, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 6</cite> (Wyo. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Permanent taking is not required
   
   in order to maintain an action for inverse condemnation under this section. The plain language of the section evinces a legislative intent to allow recompense to an owner of property not only for permanent takings, but also for damage or diminution in value, although it is applicable only to conduct on adjoining land. Waid v. State, 996 P.2d 18, <cite class="wy_code">2000 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 2000).

       Emotional distress is not a proper element of damages in an inverse condemnation action.

       Owners'
   exclusive remedy for a city's installation of a storm drain on their property in the mistaken belief that it owned an easement was in inverse condemnation. Because this remedy was available, the owners'

       District court properly dismissed a property owner's claim for inverse condemnation against a county Weed and Pest Control District, its board of directors, and four of its employees because there was no indication in the record that the owner specifically pursued the statutory remedy, nothing in the record suggested that following the available procedure would have been futile, that the District adopted a policy or pursued a practice of general applicability which was contrary to the law, or that it was improbable that the owner could obtain appropriate relief through the administrative process.

       Trial court properly entered a judgment as a matter of law because the value of the property taken was not established; the only values presented were the value of the property after the road expansion, estimated costs of amending the driveway approaches, and an overall estimate of all costs, and under either of the two measures of damages in a partial takings case, the jury would not have been able to reach a conclusion based on the limited evidence presented.

      <p>
       The landowner whose property is the subject of a partial taking is entitled to prove not only the difference between the fair market value of the property prior to the taking and the fair market value of the remainder after the taking, under the “before and after rule,” but he also is entitled to prove the value of the property rights taken. The measure of compensation is the greater of those alternative amounts. L.U. Sheep Co. v. Board of County Comm'rs, 790 P.2d 663, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 39</cite> (Wyo. 1990).

      <p>
       The Wyoming Eminent Domain Act and the cases interpreting those provisions require that the homeowners whose homes were condemned by the county receive fair market value as just compensation for any property taken by the county or, for a partial taking, the greater of the property rights taken or the amount by which the fair market value of the property is diminished. Miller v. Campbell County, 901 P.2d 1107, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 158</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

      <p>
       District court could consider evidence of comparable easements
   in determining just compensation for pipeline easements condemned
   by a carbon dioxide pipeline developer, but erroneously rejected some
   comparable easements on the basis that they were not the result of
   arms' length transactions or that they related to a natural gas pipeline.
   Further, annual payments were allowed as compensation.

       The collateral source rule is not applicable in an inverse condemnation action, and the forgiveness of mortgages or payments from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund must be credited against any compensation award for the fair market value of the land taken or for the diminution in value of land partially taken. Otherwise, the homeowners would receive a double recovery, a “windfall.” Miller v. Campbell County, 901 P.2d 1107, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 158</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

       District court could consider evidence of comparable easements in determining just compensation for pipeline easements condemned by a carbon dioxide pipeline developer, but erroneously rejected some comparable easements on the basis that they were not the result of arms' length transactions or that they related to a natural gas pipeline. Further, annual payments were allowed as compensation.

      </p>
      <p>
       Judgment on the pleadings in favor of the county was proper because the county was within its rights to enter into a public road right-of-way use agreement with a private utility company, which would allow the utility to build a proposed sewer line, because the agreement was in public's interest, it fit within scope of the easement granted by servient estates and did not increase their burden. A public road easement could be used for an underground sewer line and such right was not defeated solely because the sewer line was to be constructed by a private entity. Box L Corp. v.

     Consolidated petition for post-conviction relief and habeas corpus,
   
   filed in the district court of the county of trial and dismissed by the trial judge, was treated by the supreme court as a petition for post-conviction relief for the following reasons: (1) the court's judgment could not be impeached by a writ of habeas corpus; (2) the court in habeas corpus was not authorized to grant a new trial; (3) all issues which could have been raised in a habeas proceeding were raised in the petition for post-conviction relief; and (4) no appeal lay from the denial of the habeas petition.

       Petition for writ is required to state that the person on whose behalf it is presented, is illegally restrained of his liberty, or the writ may be granted without an application whenever the court or judge has evidence, from some proceedings before them, that any person within jurisdiction of the court or officer is illegally imprisoned or restrained of his liberty.

       While the petitioner did not file in the supreme court a copy of all the papers connected with a former proceeding, and such failure to comply with this section was specifically disapproved and might have constituted grounds for refusing the writ, since the supreme court had allowed the writ earlier, the omission was not fatal.

       If the plaintiff prevails in the final hearing on the injunction, the defendant cannot recover even if the temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction was wrongfully issued. However, good sense and equity dictate an exception to this rule when the temporary restraining order is overly broad or too far-reaching in scope. Weber v.

      An injunction or restraining
   order granted by a judge may be enforced as the act of the court,

   may be issued against the disobedient party upon satisfactory showing
   by affidavit of the breach of the injunction or restraining order.
   The disobedient party may be required by the court or judge to pay
   a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars ($200.00), to make immediate
   restitution to the party injured and to give further security to obey
   the injunction or restraining order. In default thereof, he may be

       During the dependency of a declaratory judgment action to establish rights under an easement, plaintiff used the road across defendants'
   property in violation of a court order; the district court acted within its jurisdiction in holding defendant in contempt of court and by imposing the punishment of forfeiture of the easement; the contempt proceeding was not rendered criminal even though the district court utilized criminal procedure. The course of the proceedings demonstrated that the contempt proceeding was civil pursuant to this section; the action was brought by a private party, rather than the state, to enforce compliance with the protections provided in the injunction.

       Subject matter jurisdiction existed because a movant's request that a court order a coroner to provide a more detailed verdict and case docket fell under the definition of mandamus. The fact that the movant did not caption the action as a mandamus was not fatal to the movant's claim. Williams v. Sundstrom, 2016 WY 122, 385 P.3d 789, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo.

       Under art. 5, § 3, Wyo. Const., and this section, statute, insofar as it authorizes a single judge of the supreme court in vacation to allow issuance of alternative writ of mandamus, is not repugnant to the constitution, since it merely provides a method of procedure to set in motion the original jurisdiction of such court in mandamus to state officers, and such allowance is not inhibited by the constitution. State ex rel. Bennett v. Barber, 4 Wyo. 56, 32 P. 14, <cite class="wy_code">1892 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1892).

       District court's orders were not sufficiently complete to establish that a partition in kind could be made without manifest injury to the value of the property. The fact that a dedicated ditch was not located made any finding that partition in kind would not manifestly injure the value of the property clearly erroneous. Platt v.

       Where lands of tenants in common are capable of partition, the law does not compel party moving for partition to sell his interest for the price offered by the other party, though the price exceeds valuation placed on it by the commissioners appointed in the proceedings or by the party himself, so that such offer made and refused is no ground for rejecting commissioners' report of actual partition.

       District court in partitioning a vacant lot that the parties owned as joint tenants with rights of survivorship properly ruled that each party owned an undivided, one-half interest in the property as one of the cotenants failed to rebut the presumption of equal shares. While the court could reduce one cotenant’s share of the proceeds by any disproportionate amount of property taxes and maintenance costs paid by the other cotenant, the court’s finding that the other cotenant had paid a particular sum of money in property taxes was erroneous.

      When the estate has been
   once offered and not sold, an alias writ for the sale thereof may
   be issued as often as need be. The court may order a reappraisement
   by three (3) disinterested persons of the vicinity appointed by the

   (2/3) of such appraised value, or if the court deem it for the interest

       Purpose for which action to quiet title is brought
   
   is to determine adverse claims to real property to secure repose and put at rest in one comprehensive action all adverse and conflicting claims, to fix the status of the land with respect to ownership, and to establish by decree a muniment of title to it. Barrett v. Town of Guernsey, 652 P.2d 395, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 390</cite> (Wyo. 1982).

        Nature of action. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Proceeding to quiet title is an action equitable in its nature and governed by rules pertaining to suits in equity, except where statute directs otherwise. Norris v. United Mineral Prods. Co., 61 Wyo. 386, 158 P.2d 679, <cite class="wy_code">1945 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1945).
      </p>
      <p>
       “Possession” means
   
   possession of land when one is in occupation thereof, with the intention, actually realized, of excluding occupation by others, or when, although not in actual occupation, one claims the right of exclusive occupation, and no person is in occupation opposing that claim. Ohio Oil Co. v. Wyoming Agency, 63 Wyo. 187, 179 P.2d 773, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 9</cite> (Wyo. 1947).

       In an action to quiet title to land held under alleged void tax deed, where plaintiff was not in possession, ejectment, rather than a quiet title action, was held proper remedy. Huber v. Delong, 54 Wyo. 240, 91 P.2d 53, <cite class="wy_code">1939 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1939).
      </p>
      <p>
       In consolidated civil actions involving ownership disputes among neighboring landowners, the trial court's grant of appellees'
   quiet title claim was reversed because appellees did not prove that they were in possession of the disputed portion of their tract. In fact, they proved the opposite.

        Basis for rule requiring possession by plaintiff. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule requiring actual possession by plaintiff in an action to quiet title is based on the availability of full protection through an action in ejectment or its statutory substitute. Amick v. Elwood, 77 Wyo. 269, 314 P.2d 944, <cite class="wy_code">1957 Wyo. LEXIS 24</cite> (Wyo. 1957).
      </p>
      <p>
       If land is not occupied by anyone,
   
   the plaintiff having title may sue to have his title quieted, either because the remedy exists independent of the statute or because his title gives him constructive possession. Ohio Oil Co. v. Wyoming Agency, 63 Wyo. 187, 179 P.2d 773, <cite class="wy_code">1947 Wyo. LEXIS 9</cite> (Wyo. 1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff was entitled to maintain her quiet title action where, although she did not physically reside on the property, she claimed title to it by virtue of a tax deed, visited the property on a number of occasions, paid the property taxes, made efforts to obtain title insurance and financing so that she could develop the property, and discussed the development of the property with a builder/developer.

       Because an agreement to arbitrate need not be written and can arise as the result of the conduct of parties to an existing dispute regardless of whether or not they have previously contracted for arbitration, a party, by participating in arbitration proceedings, waived its objections to the arbitrability of the dispute. While the party moved to dismiss the arbitration for untimely filing at the commencement of the hearing, such a motion could not be reshaped into an objection to jurisdiction on the grounds there was no agreement to arbitrate. The opportunity to defend or be heard upon the merits of the case was not, as the party claimed, lost forever, as a party who proceeds with arbitration over his explicit objections as to arbitrability is not foreclosed from raising the issue on a motion to confirm or vacate the award in the district court.

       Pursuant to the reasons articulated in this section and the bases set forth in case law, the district court did not err in refusing to vacate an arbitration award. There was evidence to support plaintiff's claim that her former husband's parents had promised to repay loans made over period of 12 years when plaintiff and her former husband took over the family run general store business; furthermore, there was evidence that plaintiff relied upon that promise to her detriment by not insisting upon repayment of the loans in the ordinary course of business and making considerable efforts throughout the years to assist with the business.

      A controversy over the constitutionality of exchanges of state lands without a public auction involved precisely the type of circumstance contemplated by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, for (1) this controversy impacted many stakeholders, including state-school-land lessees, the beneficiaries of the funds generated by state school lands, the legislature which had adopted statutes authorizing exchanges, those members of the executive branch of state government whose responsibility was to steward the state school lands, and the public at large; and (2) as inevitable growth and development increased the pressure on Wyoming state lands, the need for certainty and clarity regarding this aspect of the management of state lands grew.Dir. of the Office of State Lands &amp; Invs. v.

       A clear statement of the necessary elements of a justiciable controversy
   
   under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is: first, a justiciable controversy requires parties having existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interests. Second, the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate or an argument evoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion. Third, it must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the force and effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or other legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or, wanting these qualities be of such great and overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them. Finally, the proceedings must be genuinely adversary in character and not a mere disputation, but advanced with sufficient militancy to engender a thorough research and analysis of the major issues. Brimmer v. Thomson, 521 P.2d 574, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 197</cite> (Wyo. 1974); Mountain W. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hallmark Ins.

      <p>
       The mandate of this section to the effect that a party who seeks a declaration of his or her “rights, status, or other legal relations” under a contract must first show his interest is but an expression of the basic declaratory judgment law requirement, which denies access to the services of the chapter unless the parties' controversy is real and not merely imagined — in other words, it must be justiciable.

      <p>
       The “interest” requirement is but an expression of the basic doctrine that the judiciary will not invoke its remedial powers unless presented with a justiciable controversy; numerous doctrines have evolved under the justiciability umbrella, including the doctrine of mootness, and the central question in a mootness case is whether decision of a once living dispute continues to be justified by a sufficient prospect that the decision will have an impact on the parties.

      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions in a stream adjudication decree, authorizing the state engineer to monitor Indian reserved water rights, were proper, as they contemplated neither the application of state law nor the authority to deprive the Tribes of water without the assistance of the courts in a suit for the administration of the decree.

       Review of board of county commissioners' parliamentary procedural decision that a tie vote constituted no action and that it could vote again involved the board's procedures and its authority to engage in the actions at issue, which presented questions of law subject to a declaratory judgment action.

       Ordinarily, a declaratory judgment action is not a substitute for an appeal from administrative decisions. If, however, such desired relief concerns the validity and construction of agency regulations, or if it concerns the constitutionality or interpretation of a statute upon which the administrative action is, or is to be, based, it should be entertained.

      Distinctions between survival and wrongful death statutes.
    —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     The prime difference between survival and wrongful death statutes is that the survival statute merely continues a cause of action in existence and the injured party's claim after death is an asset of the estate, while the wrongful death statute creates a new cause of action for the benefit of designated persons who have suffered the loss of a loved one and provider. De Herrera v. Herrera, 565 P.2d 479, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 263</cite> (Wyo. 1977).
    </p>
    <p>
     The survival statute protects the creditors of the estate; the Wrongful Death Act does not. De Herrera v. Herrera, 565 P.2d 479, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 263</cite> (Wyo. 1977).
    </p>
    <p>
     A survival claim is based on the decedent's claim for damages sustained during his lifetime, while a wrongful death action creates a new claim or cause of action for the loss sustained by statutory beneficiaries of the decedent (directly from his death). Rosa v. Cantrell, 705 F.2d 1208, 1982 U.S. App. LEXIS 23413 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1982), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 821, 104 S. Ct. 85, 78 L. Ed. 2d 94, 1983 U.S. LEXIS 1117 (U.S. 1983).
    </p>
    <p>
     Essentials of wrongful death complaint
   
   are: (1) the plaintiff's capacity to sue as personal representative of the deceased; (2) that the plaintiffs are the persons entitled by statute to damages; (3) that the plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to show in what particular the defendant was negligent; (4) that the defendant's negligence was the proximate cause of death and (5) damages. Harris v. Grizzle, 599 P.2d 580, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 445</cite> (Wyo. 1979).

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Whenever the death of
   a person is caused by wrongful act, neglect or default such as would
   have entitled the party injured to maintain an action to recover damages
   if death had not ensued, the person who would have been liable if
   death had not ensued is liable in an action for damages, even though
   the death was caused under circumstances as amount in law to murder
   in the first or second degree or manslaughter. If the person liable
   dies, the action may be brought against the executor or administrator
   of his estate. If he left no estate within the state of Wyoming, the
   court may appoint an administrator upon application.

       Where a person is injured by another, if he dies from other causes, an action for personal injury survives; however, if death results from the same injuries, the action may not be maintained by the personal representative for the estate, but may be brought under the wrongful death act for the next of kin.

      <p>
       Recognition of a patient's loss of a chance “to live” as being actionable within the context of this section does not strain the bounds of reason, logic, or the law. A party is not required to establish the lost chance of recovery or survival in an exact percentage for the matter to be submitted to a jury. The jury is to consider evidence of percentages of the lost chance in the assessment and apportionment of damages, and the damages recoverable equals the total sum of the damages for the underlying injury or death multiplied by the percentage of the lost chance.

      <p>
       In the absence of eye witnesses to an accident or other evidence sufficient to dispel or rebut the presumption, it is presumed that the decedent, acting on the instinct of self-preservation, was exercising ordinary care. However, the presumption becomes important only when negligence is found on the part of the defendant. Absent such a finding, the question of the decedent's due care does not arise. De Julio v.

        Personal Representative. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though it is not controlling, one of the factors the district court should consider in appointing a personal representative in a wrongful death suit, particularly if the proposed appointment is contested, is the priority list contained in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.02.html#t02c04a02s2-4-201ol1a" target="_blank">2-4-201(a)</a></cite>; that statutory list reflects legislative policy as to the order of significant human relationships, and as such, it is a useful tool in considering suitability to act as personal representative. Because the filing of a wrongful death action presupposes that the personal representative intends to pursue a civil action against the alleged wrongdoer, the district court should also consider the petitioner's financial and physical ability to do so, his or her geographic location, his or her intentions in regard to legal representation, and his or her stake in the outcome; given the potential in a wrongful death action that a multitude of claimants may be coupled with a limited damages recovery, the issue of family harmony or disharmony may likewise be important in the selection of a personal representative.
   Johnson v. Johnson (In re Estate of Johnson), 2010 WY 63, 231 P.3d 873, <cite class="wy_code">2010 Wyo. LEXIS 65</cite> (Wyo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Probate court erred in appointing a decedent's father as his personal representative for the purpose of filing a wrongful death suit because the appointment of a personal representative to pursue a wrongful death claim under Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c38s1-38-101" target="_self">1-38-101</a></cite> and 102 was to be made by the district court within that wrongful death action.

      </p>
      <p>
       Appointment of a personal representative for probate proceedings was separate and distinct from the appointment of a personal representative for purposes of pursuing a wrongful death action. While it was proper for the probate court to appoint a personal representative for handling matters associated with the decedent's estate, the appointment of a personal representative to pursue a wrongful death claim was to be made by the district court within that wrongful death action.

       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in this section indicates any intention on the part of the Wyoming legislature to exclude a nonresident administrator from acting as personal representative. Certainly he or she can resort to the federal court under diversity provisions of the United States Code. Ashley v. Read Constr. Co., 195 F. Supp. 727, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2825 (D. Wyo. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        But administrator acting as personal representative must not be confused with administrator of estate
   
   whose duties and powers are set out in § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.02.html#t02c07a01s2-7-103" target="_blank">2-7-103</a></cite>; for the personal representative is required merely to collect the amount received as damages from the wrongful death and to distribute it in the manner provided by law. Ashley v. Read Constr. Co., 195 F. Supp. 727, 1961 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2825 (D. Wyo. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrator recovering for beneficiaries is trustee
   
   for them. Coliseum Motor Co. v. Hester, 43 Wyo. 298, 3 P.2d 105, <cite class="wy_code">1931 Wyo. LEXIS 27</cite> (Wyo. 1931); Bircher v. Foster, 378 P.2d 901, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo.

       </p>
       <p>

        In an action for wrongful death where petition included a general claim for damages and where no demand by defendant was made for a bill of particulars, nor was a motion made for a more specific statement in the amended petition, testimony relating to the loss sustained by reason of the future loss of the earnings of the decedent was properly admitted, and no amendment was necessary in the absence of a demand therefor.

       Where a new prison policy prohibited prisoners from keeping certain personal property items in their cells, an inmate sued the Wyoming Department of Corrections (DOC) and claimed he had been denied equal protection of the law because the legislature did not include the DOC and the Wyoming State Penitentiary within the waiver of the rule of immunity. The Supreme Court of Wyoming rejected his claim, because the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act does not differentiate between inmates and non-inmates; since the inmate sought tens of millions of dollars in compensation for more than a thousand separate pieces of property, excluding such losses from the beneficent purposes of the WGCA was rational and withstood the equal protection provisions of both the United States and the Wyoming constitutions.

The sheriff's supervision of an employee was a discretionary act and he acted in good faith when he opted not to terminate the detention officer for a prior disciplinary incident in which he admitting to taking inmate drugs; the record contained nothing to alert the sheriff of the risk that the officer would sexually assault an inmate.

       Wyoming law is clear that presentation of a notice of claim is required in order to bring an action against a governmental entity and the failure to comply with that condition precedent results in dismissal. There is no requirement under Wyoming law that presentation of the notice of claim has to be alleged in the complaint; likewise, district courts do not lack jurisdiction over an action against a governmental entity if presentation of a claim is not alleged.

       The Wyoming legislature recognizes the  inherently unfair and inequitable results which occur in the strict  application of the doctrine of governmental immunity and is cognizant  of the Wyoming Supreme Court decision of Oroz v. Board of County Commissioners 575 P.2d 1155 (1978). It is further recognized that the state and its political  subdivisions as trustees of public revenues are constituted to serve  the inhabitants of the state of Wyoming and furnish certain services  not available through private parties and, in the case of the state,  state revenues may only be expended upon legislative appropriation.  This act is adopted by the legislature to balance the respective equities  between persons injured by governmental actions and the taxpayers  of the state of Wyoming whose revenues are utilized by governmental  entities on behalf of those taxpayers. This act is intended to retain  any common law defenses which a defendant may have by virtue of decisions  from this or other jurisdictions.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c39s1-39-102ol1b">
       In the case of the state, this act abolishes  all judicially created categories such as “governmental” or “proprietary”  functions and “discretionary” or “ministerial” acts previously used  by the courts to determine immunity or liability. This act does not  impose nor allow the imposition of strict liability for acts of governmental  entities or public employees.

      <p>
       Where a new prison policy prohibited prisoners from keeping certain personal property items in their cells, an inmate sued the Wyoming Department of Corrections (DOC) and claimed he had been denied equal protection of the law because the legislature did not include the DOC and the Wyoming State Penitentiary within the waiver of the rule of immunity; the Supreme Court of Wyoming rejected his claim, because the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act (WGCA) does not differentiate between inmates and non-inmates. The inmate's claim was subject to rational scrutiny; since the inmate sought tens of millions of dollars in compensation for more than a thousand separate pieces of property, excluding such losses from the beneficent purposes of the WGCA was rational and withstood the equal protection provisions of both the United States and the Wyoming constitutions.

       A housing inspection is not one of the enumerated public utility or ground transportation service exceptions to the waiver of immunity. Worden v. Village Homes, 821 P.2d 1291, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo. LEXIS 183</cite> (Wyo. 1991).

      <p>
       This section does not, within its language, include the authorities that license the public employees or entities that provide gas, electric, transportation and other listed services. Thus, the enforcement of this state's financial responsibility laws by employees of the department of revenue and taxation, financial responsibility division, is not included in the waiver of immunity articulated by this section.

       The court properly granted summary judgment for a city, where the plaintiff's claim asserted that the city council was negligent in adopting an ordinance which required the use of an iron pipe in a water system, which proved over time to be unsatisfactory or perhaps even ill-considered. The claim did not fit the niche provided by subsection (a), nor was it one which fell within the statutory exceptions to the general immunity provided for in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-104" target="_self">1-39-104</a></cite>.Sawyer v.

       Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-108" target="_self">1-39-108</a></cite> waives immunity for the negligence of public employees in the operation of public utilities and services including, solid or liquid waste collection or disposal. In other words, the statute waives immunity for negligence in keeping a public utility operable or functional.

       Because a city's negligence in failing to ascertain ownership of property before installing a storm drain was unrelated to the operation and function of the storm drain, it did not constitute negligence in the operation of a public utility.

       Exception to governmental immunity for negligence in the operation of a public utility did not apply to a school district since the district's provision of ground transportation by busses, which allegedly contributed to the death of a student passenger, was not operation of a public utility, even though it served a public interest.

       Waiver of sovereign immunity did not apply to a former state employee's defamation claim because the claim did not rest on any actions involved in keeping a landfill operable or functional, but instead arose from the termination of the employee's employment.

      <p>
       Considering the requirements for qualified immunity and their definitions, cases involving the defense of qualified immunity should rarely be disposed of by Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal. Darrar v. Bourke, 910 P.2d 572, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Unlike absolute immunity, a determination that qualified immunity is generally available to peace officers is not sufficient to sustain a motion to dismiss. The defense of qualified immunity presents mixed questions of fact and law. These questions are better suited for resolution at the summary judgment stage of the proceedings after the facts are sufficiently developed. Darrar v. Bourke, 910 P.2d 572, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1996).

       Without a determination that the officers were not acting within the scope of their duties or that their conduct was not tortious, the governmental entity does not escape liability for the tortious acts of its peace officers.

       A highway patrolman, who was allegedly negligent in not having an icy road sanded after being called to the scene of an accident, was not immune from suit under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-104ol1a" target="_self">1-39-104(a)</a></cite>, even though this section refers only to a “governmental entity.” His immunity was purely dependent upon the immunity of the state. His protection was found not in immunity, but in the duty of the state under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-104ol1b" target="_self">1-39-104(b)</a></cite> to provide him a defense and to indemnify him.

       Plaintiff in wrongful death action may prevail only if plaintiff has alleged sufficient facts to establish that off-duty police officer was acting within his scope of duties at the time he responded to an emergency bulletin.

      </p>
      <p>
       In wrongful death action, if the trier of fact determined that off-duty police officer was not acting within the scope of his official duties, then the municipality and the police officer would be insulated from liability under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act. If, however, the trier of fact determined that the officer was acting within the scope of his official duties and was authorized to act at the accident scene, and that he, therefore, owed a legal duty to the deceased, liability should be determined as it would be in any negligence case.

       An officer was not negligent in failing to conduct more extensive sobriety testing on an intoxicated driver who injured another where informal sobriety tests conducted on the driver did not indicate that the driver was legally intoxicated. That an intoxicated driver or other law violator causes injury to another does not, without more, necessarily mean that a governmental entity or public employee was negligent. Keehn ex rel. Keehn v.

       A cause of action against the parole board and its officers for permitting a parolee to leave the state, after which he committed various murders, could not be maintained, as the defendants were not “law enforcement officers” and, hence, were not subject to claim or liability because of governmental immunity.

       Wyoming Governmental
   Claims Act's (WGCA) omission of a reference to the tolling provision
   contained in the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act of 2005 evidences
   the legislature's intent that the tolling provision does not apply
   in the context of the notice-of-claim requirement under the WGCA;
   accordingly, the tolling provision in the Medical Review Panel Act
   does not operate to toll the two-year period for submitting a notice
   of claim to a governmental entity under the WGCA. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 87</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

      <p>
       Plain language
   of the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act of 2005 unambiguously indicates
   the tolling period applies to the filing of a “complaint”
   in any court against a health care provider, but a notice of claim
   is not a “complaint” that must be filed in a “court”;
   it must be submitted to the governmental entity alleged to have been
   responsible for causing harm to the claimant, and if the condition
   is satisfied, the claimant is subject to a one-year statute of limitations
   for filing an action. Stroth v. N. Lincoln County Hosp. Dist., 2014 WY 81, 327 P.3d 121, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 87</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

An analysis of the school district rules, regulations and statements of policy demonstrated that the defendant could not have been requested, required or authorized to enter into a contract for employment for a teaching position with the plaintiff and, if he did so, he could not have been acting within the “scope of his duties” as a public employee. Therefore, the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, including the one-year period of limitations found in this section, did not apply. Milton v. Mitchell, 762 P.2d 372, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo.

       Plaintiff was not estopped from asserting that defendant acted outside “scope of duties”
   
   because of the allegation in his claim that he had been injured due to the defendant's actions, who “was acting within the scope and course of his employment.” Alternative pleading is authorized by Rule 8(e), W.R.C.P., and is not the same as the changing of statements of fact in separate proceedings.

       Where persons injured in collisions with State employees presented putative notices of claim that were neither signed by them nor certified under penalty of perjury, those notices of claim were invalid because they did not meet the requirements of Wyo. Const. art. 16, § 7, and the belated attempts to cure the deficiencies were ineffective because the limitation period of the nonclaim statute had passed, thereby extinguishing the statutory right to sue the State, and the plaintiffs did not show that the deficient notices of claim were, or could be, salvaged by the savings statute, by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, or as a matter of public policy.

       The Governmental Claims Act did not confer jurisdiction upon a district court to declare that the United States government's printing of paper money was unconstitutional and that, therefore, a worker's compensation claimant was entitled to be paid in gold or silver. Further, such a claim was frivolous and there was no reasonable cause for the appeal from its dismissal, justifying an award, under Rule 10.05, W.R.A.P., of a fee of $100 as part of the costs.

      </p>
      <p>
       Litigant's failure to allege compliance with constitutional and statutory requirements does not and cannot affect a court's subject matter jurisdiction to act; pursuant to the constitution and this section, the district courts have jurisdiction to hear and decide actions brought against governmental entities, whether or not compliance is alleged, if a notice of claim complying with the constitutional and statutory requirements has been presented. District courts also have jurisdiction to allow the amendment of a complaint to allege presentation of a notice of claim complying with the statute and constitution when such a notice was in fact timely presented; to the extent that Board of Trustees of UW v. Bell, 662 P.2d 410, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 310</cite> (Wyo. 1983), and its progeny held otherwise, those decisions are overruled.

       When plaintiff injured motorist filed suit against defendant city after his vehicle was struck by a vehicle driven by a police officer, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction under this section to determine whether plaintiff complied with the requirements of Wyo.

       Where a new prison policy prohibited prisoners from keeping certain personal property items in their cells, an inmate sued the Wyoming Department of Corrections (DOC) and claimed he had been denied equal protection of the law because the legislature did not include the DOC and the Wyoming State Penitentiary within the waiver of the rule of immunity; the Supreme Court of Wyoming rejected his claim, because the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act does not differentiate between inmates and non-inmates. The inmate's claim was subject to rational scrutiny; since the inmate sought tens of millions of dollars in compensation for more than a thousand separate pieces of property, excluding such losses from the beneficent purposes of the WGCA was rational and withstood the equal protection provisions of both the United States and the Wyoming constitutions.

       A trial court's order that convicted arsonists pay an additional $1,500 victims' compensation surcharge was simply an alternative way of ordering the arsonists to pay restitution for the victims' loss of enjoyment of life. Such awards are improper. Meerscheidt v. State, 931 P.2d 220, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 7</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

    Compensation from benefits of crime.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature finds
   that the state has a compelling interest in preventing any person
   who is convicted of a criminal act from profiting from the criminal
   act and in recompensing victims of the criminal act. It is therefore
   the intent of the legislature to provide a mechanism whereby any profits
   from a criminal act that are received by the person convicted of the
   criminal act are available as restitution to the victims of the criminal
   act.

       § 1-41-101.
    Legislative findings and intent.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The legislature recognizes
   that certain liability insurance policies of the state of Wyoming
   have been cancelled, that no responsive bids have been received and
   that there exists a need to develop a method to handle claims brought
   under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t01c39s1-39-101" target="_self">1-39-101</a></cite> et seq.] and arising under federal law. The legislature
   declares that the appropriate remedy is to create an account for self-insurance
   of the state and to provide for a loss prevention program. It is the
   intent of the legislature that the self-insurance account shall be
   operated on an actuarially sound basis. The legislature further declares
   that its intent is that the availability of commercial liability insurance
   coverage shall be explored considering the possibility that the insurance
   industry can provide coverage in the future that is less expensive
   than the costs of providing a loss prevention program and paying for
   claims out of the self-insurance account.

       A federal § 1983 claim against a county sheriff in his or her official capacity is not covered by this chapter because a § 1983 official capacity action against a sheriff is really a § 1983 claim against the county and therefore is not a claim “against a peace officer employed by … a local government arising under 42 USCS 1983,” as is required by subsection (c)(iv).
