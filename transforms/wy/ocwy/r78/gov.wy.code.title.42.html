            <p>
                Laws 2004, ch. 101, § 1, effective April 1, 2004, provides:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
      “(a)
     </b> For the period beginning July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005 for the first ten (10) deliveries performed by each physician who averages fewer than fifty (50) deliveries per year for calendar years 2001 through 2003 and which were
                paid for under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act, there may be an additional malpractice insurance compensation payment of two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per delivery. No physician shall be eligible for an
                additional malpractice insurance compensation payment under this section unless the physician is located in an area of this state which is more than thirty (30) miles from not more than one (1) other physician providing obstetric services
                as determined by the department of health. For calendar year 2004 only deliveries performed on or after the effective date of this act may be so compensated. Deliveries before the effective date may not be counted.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
      “(b)
     </b> If in any year the funds appropriated for the purposes of this act are expended and there are additional deliveries that would otherwise be eligible for compensation under subsection (a) of this section, no payments in excess
                of appropriated funds shall be made, however the joint appropriations interim committee shall be informed that the funds are expended and shall be given an estimate of the supplemental appropriation that would be required to pay for the
                additional eligible deliveries.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
      “(c)
     </b> The department of health may make the payments on behalf of the state and may utilize a fiscal agent to do so. The department of health may structure the payments in any way to capture any federal share available under the Medicaid
                program, provided the payment structure makes the full payment authorized to each physician participating for the first ten (10) eligible deliveries.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
      “(d)
     </b> If a community is without obstetric services and the physicians who had previously provided obstetric services have purchased the insurance coverage known as tail coverage to provide coverage for incidents occurring but not discovered
                while they were providing obstetric services, the health department may contract to purchase any such additional coverage that may be required at the end of this program if the physicians will return to provide obstetric services for recipients
                eligible for services under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services Act for the duration of this program.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>
      “(e)
     </b> The Wyoming legislature finds that the payment authorized by this act is necessary to assure the continued availability of obstetric services for recipients eligible for services under the Wyoming Medical Assistance and Services
                Act and thus constitutes a necessary support of the poor as permitted by Article 16, Section 6 of the Wyoming Constitution.”

                                in determining the time spent on assistance for the purposes of this section. Adults who previously received assistance as a dependent child, excluding minor parents, shall be allowed up to the five (5) year lifetime limit

                                W.S. 42-2-104 shall not be subject to the limitation imposed under this paragraph. For an individual who is such a caretaker, the department shall waive any work requirements that unduly interfere with the provision of
                                care and may waive other program requirements as appropriate. For purposes of this section an individual is totally disabled or incapacitated if he has a physical or mental impairment to the extent that it prevents the
                                individual from achieving independent living, full-time employment, or participation in job training programs that will reasonably lead to independent living and monetary self sufficiency. The department may consult a licensed

                        The requirement of due process of law that an opportunity be afforded to be heard on issues of adjudicative facts does not extend to hearings on legislative facts. Where the only questions of fact which an aid-to-dependent-children claimant claimed could
                        be determined at the fair hearing were: (1) that the new assistance unit factors were not properly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) that the need level, which ultimately determined the amount of the benefit
                        for a given assistance unit, was not properly established, the “facts” which would have been resolved in a hearing were legislative facts. Walker v. Karpan, 726 P.2d 82, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 615</cite>                        (Wyo. 1986).

                        Revised basis for the decision of the Department of Health for Medicaid to deny a nursing home resident’s application for a reduction in her penalty period was not properly before the supreme court because a post hoc change in its basis was contrary to
                        the resident’s procedural rights and prejudicial to her interests; the Department’s written notice cited only one basis, and because the resident had no notice of its revised basis, she was deprived an opportunity to correct the
                        problem. Anderson v. State ex rel. Dep't of Health, 2018 WY 135, 430 P.3d 1162, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 139</cite> (Wyo. 2018).

                Laws 2013, ch. 117, § 1 directs “(a) The department of health shall proceed with a reform and redesign of the Wyoming Medicaid program to include the following elements that were identified by the department in its final report on the Medicaid options
                study performed pursuant to 2012 Wyoming Laws, Chapter 103: (i) Concerning all health care and waiver services, the department shall, to the extent practical, implement: (A) Use of incentives to encourage recipients to engage in designated
                activities or behaviors to achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle; (B) Use of incentives to encourage health care providers to meet identified, measurable performance outcomes in the provision of health care; (C) Decreased use of emergency
                rooms for nonemergency care by such methods as a nurse triage hotline, targeted education and increased monitoring for excessive utilization and inappropriate drug seeking behavior; (D) An evaluation of enhanced use of managed care using
                tiers of services and more intense management for high cost clients. The department shall explore the use of managed care for all or a designated part of the Medicaid population, with the goal of delivering care of the same or better quality
                as currently delivered but at reduced cost. The managed care plan shall include identification of goals, outcome measurements and evaluation tools. The department may initiate the process of federal approval for necessary state plan amendments;
                (E) Inclusion of supplementary services at the time a prospective client applies for Medicaid benefits, such as referrals to other benefit programs and job training resources; (F) Expansion of prenatal services to all women whose children
                are likely to be eligible for Medicaid; (G) Expansion of available behavioral health services, with particular attention to persons with serious and persistent mental illness or serious psychological distress; (H) Increased fraud prevention
                and reduction activities; (J) Use of a capitated payment model instead of a fee-for-service payment model for some health care providers, including predetermined bundled payments for specific health events or time periods; (K) Use of health
                homes to coordinate patient care; (M) Screening, brief intervention and referral for treatment for pregnancy and maternity care; (N) Enhanced healthcare management for foster care children. (ii) Concerning long term care services, the
                department shall, to the extent practical, implement: (A) Development of an assessment tool to replace the "Assessment of Medical Necessity for Long Term Care" required by W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t42c06s42-6-102" target="_self">42-6-102</a></cite>;
                (B) Redesign of nursing facility reimbursements to reflect patient acuity, percentage of Medicaid occupancy and regional economic factors; (C) Elimination of the caps on the number of clients admitted to the long term care and assisted
                living facility waiver programs. The objective shall be to optimize the services provided to current clients and to extend appropriate services to persons currently on waiting lists for waiver services within the current budget. (iii)
                Concerning developmental disability and acquired brain injury services, the department shall, to the extent practical, implement: (A) Creation of two (2) separate waiver programs, including one (1) for supportive services and one (1) for
                comprehensive services. The objective shall be to optimize the services provided to current clients and to extend appropriate services to persons currently on waiting lists for waiver services within the current budget; (B) Creation of
                individual budget amounts for each person served on the waivers to reflect assessed individual needs in consultation with the clients' guardians, and as appropriate, current case managers and providers; (C) Replacement where possible of
                higher cost residential and day habilitation services with lower cost, more integrated services; (D) The department shall develop a plan to determine the needs of individual clients, placement options and continuum of care that recognizes
                change of need and change of circumstances over time; (E) Provide for a case management system for the waiver programs that is free of conflicts of interest. (b) The department shall hold at least two (2) informational meetings to provide
                opportunities for clients, guardians and service providers affected by the program changes proposed in paragraph (a)(iii) of this section to provide testimony. The department shall provide notice to those clients, guardians and service
                providers at least two (2) weeks prior to each meeting. (c) The department of health shall make a preliminary report by October 1, 2013 and a final report by October 1, 2014 to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee
                regarding the status of the reform and redesign of the Medicaid program pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The report shall separately identify those items that have been implemented or are scheduled for implementation and those
                items that are contingent on a state Medicaid plan amendment or approval of a waiver by the centers for Medicare and Medicaid services. To the extent practicable, the report shall include an estimate of the costs or savings associated
                with each reform and redesign item.”

                ending June 30, 2014. This appropriation shall only be expended for the purpose of studying and developing an implementation plan for Medicaid reform pursuant to this act. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this appropriation
                shall not be transferred or expended for any other purpose and any unexpended, unobligated funds remaining from this appropriation shall revert as provided by law on June 30, 2014. This appropriation shall not be included in the department's
                2015-2016 standard biennial budget request. (b) The department of health shall have the authority to contract with experts and consultants as may be useful in conducting any study provided for in this act. In contracting for services with
                experts and consultants for purposes of conducting any study, the department shall be exempt from the procurement requirements set out in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.09.html#t09c02a10s9-2-1016" target="_blank">9-2-1016</a></cite>                and any other state laws, rules or policies governing the procurement of services by a state agency other than the requirement for approval of those contracts by the attorney general. This exemption shall expire on June 30, 2014 or upon
                completion of the study, whichever occurs first.”

                        Pharmacist's contention that the district court improperly applied res judicata when the Medicaid rules did not allow him to request an administrative hearing was without merit because the pharmacist was entitled to an administrative hearing, and the

                        problem; (2) determine the level of costs shifted to private pay and private insurance customers; (3) determine if access to services, especially trauma services, is endangered for both paying patients and patients unable to pay
                        due to poverty; (4) determine if reimbursement problems are endangering implementation of an effective trauma care system in Wyoming; (5) determine if state, county or local hospital district financial support for reimbursement
                        problems identified by the report will provide long term solutions to the reimbursement problems; (6) consider reasonable alternatives for reimbursing hospitals and other health care providers for unreimbursed catastrophic care
                        and unreimbursed trauma care; (7) consider the differences in existing local support for hospitals and other local health care providers; (8) explore the cost feasibility of a state, county or local hospital district funded catastrophic
                        insurance policy to cover all Wyoming citizens; (9) consider state, county, hospital district and other funding sources to address any needs identified by the study; and (10) if state support is identified as a reasonable long
                        term option to address problems identified by the report, determine: (a) the long term financial impact to the state of the program; (b) the formula for distributing the funds; (c) potential revenue sources to cover the cost of
                        the long term assistance; and (d) the impact of state support on the expansion or growth of trauma care programs because of the state support. The final report of the study is to be submitted to the joint labor, health and social

                        of prosecution under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t42c04a01s42-4-111ol1a" target="_self">42-4-111(a)</a></cite>. Mellott v. State, 2019 WY 23, 435 P.3d 376, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

                        law, clearly demonstrates the legislature’s intent to criminalize individual acts that violate § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t42c04a01s42-4-111ol1a" target="_self">42-4-111(a)</a></cite> as separate chargeable offenses. When a
                        provider falsely states something, misrepresents something, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any given Medicaid claim submitted for payment, the provider violates § 42-4-111(a). Whether any given violation vis-`-vis
                        an individual claim for payment constitutes a felony or a misdemeanor offense expressly depends on the dollar value of that particular claim for payment. Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 42-4-111(a)-(b). Mellott v. State, 2019 WY 23, 435 P.3d

                        felony threshold, and thus, trial counsel’s performance was deficient. Because the record, including the sentencing hearing and plea withdrawal proceedings, did not show a factual basis for her guilty plea as to those felony counts,
                        defendant was prejudiced by her trial counsel’s deficient performance. Mellott v. State, 2019 WY 23, 435 P.3d 376, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 23</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

                    chapter. The department and its contract attorneys shall have an unconditional right to intervene in any action by or on behalf of a recipient or former recipient against any third party who may be legally liable to reimburse any medical
                    assistance provided under the Wyoming Medicaid program. If no action has been brought, the department and its contract attorneys may initiate and prosecute an independent action on behalf of the department against any third party that
                    may be liable to the person to whom the care was furnished. If the department elects not to contract with private attorneys to provide legal services and representation under this section, the attorney general, or an appropriate county
                    attorney, shall provide the legal services and representation.

                        of a claim for health care items or services, including but not limited to hospitalization, pharmaceutical services, physician services, nursing services and other medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department
                        for the care and treatment of the applicant or recipient. An applicant or recipient or legally liable party, by the act of applying for, or recipient receiving medical assistance, shall be deemed to have made a subrogation assignment
                        and an assignment of claim for benefits to the department. The department shall inform an applicant of the assignments at the time of application. In addition, any entitlements from a contractual agreement with an applicant or
                        recipient or legally liable party, a state or federal program or a claim or action against any responsible third party for medical services, not to exceed the amount expended by the department, shall be so assigned. The entitlements
                        shall be directly reimbursable to the department by third party payors. The department may assign its right to subrogation or its entitlement to benefits to a designee or a health care provider participating in the medicaid program
                        and providing services to an applicant or recipient, in order to assist the provider in obtaining payment for the services. A provider that has received an assignment from the department shall notify the insurer of the assignment
                        upon rendering of services to the applicant or recipient. Failure to so notify the insurer shall render the provider ineligible for payment from the department. Once the insurer has been billed or notified the provider may not
                        request payment through the medicaid program until a payment, denial or other explanation of benefits, not including mistakes in billing, is received from the insurer. The provider shall notify the department of any request by
                        the applicant or recipient or his legally liable party or representative for billing information.
