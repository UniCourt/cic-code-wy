       An agreement pursuant to this act may create a joint powers board to conduct a joint or cooperative undertaking. A joint powers board shall consist of not fewer than five (5) members, all of whom shall be qualified electors of the counties in which the board operates. Members of a joint powers board shall be appointed by the governing bodies of the participating agencies in any proportion or number the bodies feel would adequately reflect their interest. The initial appointments shall be by mutual agreement with staggered terms of one (1), two (2) and three (3) years and are subject to reappointment. Thereafter, appointments for a full term shall be for three (3) year staggered terms. Vacancies for unexpired terms shall be filled by appointment by the governing bodies of the participating agencies. Members of the board may be removed by the governing bodies of the participating agencies. It is not incompatible office holding for an officer or legal representative of a county, municipal corporation, school district, special district, public institution, agency, board, commission or political subdivision to be a member of a joint powers board.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c01a01s16-1-106ol1b">
       Promptly following appointment of its members, a joint powers board shall meet, organize and elect from its membership a chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer. The secretary of a joint powers board shall notify the participating agencies of the board’s organization and shall file a certificate with the county clerk and the secretary of state showing its organization. Upon filing the certificate, the joint powers board shall automatically become a body corporate and politic, and a public corporation with power to sue and be sued. The corporation has perpetual existence unless otherwise specified by the agreement providing for the corporation. No individual member of a joint powers board shall be personally liable for any actions or procedure of a joint powers board. When actually engaged in the performance of their duties, members of a joint powers board shall receive no compensation but shall be reimbursed for travel and per diem expenses as provided to state employees.
      </li>
      <li id="t16c01a01s16-1-106ol1c">
       A joint powers board shall meet at least once every three (3) months at the call of the chairman or within five (5) days after an oral or written request of a majority of the board members.

       Within the limits of its authorized and available funds, a joint powers board may employ technical, legal, administrative and clerical assistance and engage the services of research and consulting agencies. In the performance of its duties a joint powers board may utilize the services of any officer or employee of a participating agency with the approval of the governing body of the agency. Upon request of a joint powers board elected and appointed officers and employees of participating agencies shall promptly furnish the board information, statistics and reports under their control and shall otherwise cooperate with a joint powers board.

       Any agency participating in a joint powers project may appoint a joint powers board created by the agreement or any of the other agencies participating in the project as its agent to manage the project or to manage the finances of the project. The joint powers agreement may create a single fiscal manager to receive monies and make disbursements for the entire project. The fiscal manager may set up any necessary sinking funds, reserve funds or building funds for the use of the project.

     The requirement of due process of law that an opportunity be afforded to be heard on issues of adjudicative facts does not necessarily encompass any similar hearing on legislative facts. Where the only questions of fact which an Aid to Dependent Children claimant claims could be determined at the fair hearing are: (1) that the new assistance unit factors were not properly promulgated under the Administrative Procedure Act; and (2) that the need level, which ultimately determines the amount of the benefit for a given assistance unit, was not properly established, the “facts” which she would have resolved in a hearing are legislative facts.

       When an agency finds that an emergency requires the agency to proceed without notice or opportunity for hearing required by subsection (a) of this section, it may adopt emergency rules. An emergency rule is effective when filed. A state agency emergency rule shall bear the endorsement of the governor’s concurrence on the finding of emergency before the registrar of rules accepts the rule for filing. The rule so adopted shall be effective for no longer than one hundred twenty (120) days but the adoption of an identical rule under W.S. 16-3-103(a) or of an emergency rule under this subsection is not precluded. In no case shall identical or substantially similar emergency rules be effective for a total period of more than two hundred forty (240) days. A local agency may proceed with the emergency rule when notice of the emergency is filed with the local registrar of rules.

During the process of approving rules, the governor may disapprove any portion of a rule not conforming to paragraphs (d)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section by clearly indicating the portion of the rule disapproved and the basis for the disapproval. Only those portions of a rule approved by the governor shall be filed with the registrar of rules as provided by W.S. 16-3-104(a). Any portion of a rule disapproved by the governor shall be returned to the agency and shall be null and void and shall not be filed, implemented or enforced. The governor shall report his disapproval of any rule or portion thereof to the management council within fifteen (15) days.

       Medical Commission Hearing Panel's order denying the claimant workers' compensation benefits for gastrointestinal problems violated the Wyoming Administrative Procedures Act by failing to make basic findings of fact that supported its ultimate findings; the decision cited no evidence or medical opinions and made no basic findings to support its conclusion that the claimant's condition changed substantially after August 2002 or to explain the conclusion that had the narcotic pain medications been responsible for the esophageal stricture, it would have appeared earlier.

       In a contested case proceeding, the State Board of Equalization violated the natural gas processing and production company's procedural due process rights in an administrative proceeding by depriving the company of an opportunity to participate. The board remanded the case to the department of revenue for adoption of a more determinative formula for computation of comparable value based upon reasonable inferences from third-party natural gas processing fees without allowing the company to participate. Because the formula depended upon factual ascertainment in order to properly compute those taxes, the nonparticipating company was deprived of its due process rights. Amoco Prod. Co. v.

       Neither the concealed weapon statute nor the Administrative Procedures Act contains a requirement for a hearing where an application for a concealed weapon permit is denied. The concealed weapon statute allows an aggrieved applicant the opportunity to rebut the department of criminal investigation's findings and conclusions through a request for reconsideration. The Administrative Procedures Act requires only a hearing for contested cases where legal rights exist which are to be determined after an opportunity for a trial-type rehearing.

Such a requirement imposes upon an agency the duty to make findings of basic facts upon all of the material issues in the proceeding and upon which its ultimate findings of fact or conclusions are based. Unless that is done, there is no rational basis for judicial review. Pan Am. Petroleum Corp. v. Wyoming Oil &amp; Gas Conservation Comm'n, 446 P.2d 550, <cite class="wy_code">1968 Wyo.

       This section requires findings of basic facts upon all of the material issues in the proceeding and upon which the ultimate findings of fact or conclusions are based.

It would do little good to remand the matter in order for the County Board to state the obvious, that it found the 1998 allocated value, derived from an arms length transaction and provided by the taxpayer, fairly included economic obsolescence in 2001.

   not violate this section by offering advice in response to questions

        Employee’s workers’ compensation request for judicial review was dismissed because, (1) statutorily, only district courts in the counties where the administrative action was taken or the employee resided had jurisdiction, (2) the failure of the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation Division (Division) to appeal the denial of a motion to dismiss did not waive jurisdiction, and (3) the statute did not merely specify venue. McCallister v. State ex rel. Dep't of Workforce Servs., 2019 WY 47, 440 P.3d 1078, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 47</cite> (Wyo. 2019); McCallister, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo.

       <p>
        Wyoming Supreme Court may not use the Court’s statutory rulemaking power to label the requirement of filing an appeal in a workers’ compensation case in the correct district court a matter of venue rather than jurisdiction because the legislature specifically designated the courts where a party is “entitled to” judicial review.

        The district court has jurisdiction to review the disciplinary suspension of a police officer where the rules and regulations of the police department's civil service commission provide that an officer may petition the commission for a hearing upon discharge, or reduction of classification or compensation, the commission grants a hearing to the officer as though he has been reduced in compensation, and the rules then provide that the contested-case proceedings of the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act must be following.

       <p>
        When a case initiated in an administrative agency comes before the supreme court on appeal, the court does not give any special deference to the decision of the district court, but rather reviews the case as if it came to the court directly from the agency.

        County assessor's valuation of the taxpayer's personal property at its coal mines, which were purchased in 1998, was supported by substantial evidence as required by this section because the taxpayer failed to overcome the presumption that the assessor's valuation was correct, and the mere difference of opinion between the appraisers was not sufficient to establish a valuation error. Also the assessor's use of the 1998 purchase price, rather than the original cost of the individual items of property, as the starting place for the cost method of appraisal was consistent with the regulations, applicable law, and guidelines, which seemed to direct it; and the assessor correctly reasoned that the recentness of the purchase obviated the need to do an economic obsolescence calculation because the 1998 value was derived from an arms length transaction, was provided by the taxpayer, and fairly included economic obsolescence in 2001.

        The test as to whether or not there is substantial evidence has been said to be whether the administrative decision finds reasonable support in substantial evidence, whether the evidence reasonably tends to support the findings, or, it has been indicated, whether the decision is not clearly contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence.

        The record contained substantial evidence to support the hearing examiner's conclusion that a worker's compensation claimant failed to meet his burden of proving the compensability of his back injury.

       <p>
        Claimant provided clear and convincing evidence that his self-inflicted gunshot wound was a direct and proximate result of his compensable work-related injuries and the hearing examiner's decision otherwise was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence where both the claimant's treating physician and a licensed clinical psychologist stated that the claimant's compensable injury caused pain and depression that led to the suicide attempt. Brierley v. State ex rel. Wyo. Workers' Safety &amp; Comp. Div. (In re Worker's Comp. Claim), 2002 WY 121, 52 P.3d 564, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 129</cite> (Wyo. 2002).

       <p>
        The record contained substantial evidence to support the hearing examiner's denial of coverage for injuries to the claimant's knee and neck; although medical and other evidence supported the view that the claimant's work accident materially aggravated her preexisting neck and knee conditions, the claimant did not meet her burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the work accident, not her preexisting condition, caused her injuries.

While the employee contacted six employers in October 2000, the employee only submitted four actual employment applications; the employee contacted two employers in 2001, but submitted no employment applications; just days before submitting an application for permanent partial disability, the employee contacted six other employers, yet did not submit a single employment application; and the employee had not pursued potential alternative occupation positions that were available.

        Though a worker was hired as a pipe inspector, he suffered a fatal heart attack while working as truck driver; since substantial evidence supported the finding of the Wyoming Medical Commission that the stress on the day he died was not clearly abnormal to or unusual for truck drivers, his widow's death benefit claim was properly denied.

       <p>
        In a worker's compensation case where claimant filed for permanent partial disability benefits, a hearing examiner's failure to make a determination regarding the weight and credibility of his testimony, coupled with the failure to consider all of the material evidence offered, rendered the order denying benefits insufficient to permit appellate review under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c03s16-3-114ol1c" target="_self">16-3-114(c)</a></cite>. Thus, the supreme court reversed and remanded the matter to the district court with instructions to vacate the order denying benefits and remanded the case to the Wyoming Office of Administrative Hearings for further findings.

        Wyoming Medical Commission's decision denying a claimant workers' compensation benefits was not arbitrary and capricious based on the fact that there was an absence of promulgated legislation, rules, and regulations for the determination of whether thoracic outlet syndrome existed and whether it was work-related in Wyoming.

        Permanent partial disability benefits were properly awarded to a claimant because substantial evidence supported hearing examiner's determination that claimant sought suitable work pursuant to Wyo.

       <p>
        Hearing examiner's determination that the claimant failed to prove a causal relationship between the fusion surgery and the 2006 work incident was not against the overwhelming weight of the evidence because the medical evidence was not entirely consistent with the claimant's contention that he did not injury his back until he slipped on ice on his employer's parking lot in 2006.

       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing examiner's decision to give the claimant's treating physician's opinion little weight was supported by substantial evidence because the physician based his opinion on an incomplete medical history, he was not aware that the claimant had complained of back pain and sought medical attention prior to the 2006 injury, and had been diagnosed with lumbar spine degenerative disease. The physician did not address how the claimant's preexisted degenerative condition might have affected his need for the fusion surgery, nor did he provide a detailed explanation as to why he reached the conclusion that the claimant's back condition was caused by the 2006 work injury.

        Because claimant did not seek medical attention for his lower back for almost 25 years after his work related injuries, the hearing examiner's conclusion that claimant did not meet his burden of proving that his back surgery was the result of his work related injuries was supported by substantial evidence under this section.

        Claimant was properly denied workers' compensation benefits where the Wyoming Medical Commission found that the employee's physical actions during the hearing were inconsistent with his reported physical difficulties, that his arm and hand symptoms were not medically consistent with the radiographic findings of abnormalities in the thoracic spine, and that the majority of abnormal findings in the thoracic spine were right-sided, while the employee predominantly complained of left side problems. The facts fully supported the Commission's ultimate conclusion that the employee did not meet his burden of proof that his injuries were work related. Burd v. State ex rel. Wyo.

The employee failed to show that the employer's reason for terminating him was pretextual because, other than the employee's assertion that the supervisor made a discriminatory statement early on in the supervisor's tenure, the employee provided no details about the context or timing of the supervisor's ageist comments, and none of the employee's submissions indicated that the supervisor's remarks were made in connection with his discharge.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.31.html#t31c06s31-6-102" target="_blank">31-6-102</a></cite> because: (1) the trooper stated that he saw the driver's vehicle cross over the center line and the fog line more than once; and (2) the OAH reviewed the DVD of the incident, which showed the vehicle drifting from one side of lane to the other more than once and therefore corroborated the trooper's statements, even though it did not depict clearly whether the vehicle crossed over the lines due to its poor quality and limited duration. Taken together, the trooper's report and the DVD constituted relevant evidence from which a reasonable mind could conclude that the trooper had probable cause to stop the vehicle for a traffic violation, namely driving under the influence or failing to drive within the lanes.

       A district court may use redaction as one of the remedies to vindicate the public's interests in access to public records. Redaction is an appropriate tool to be used in circumstances concerning disclosure of public records, and is well established in case law, as well as in statutes. Allsop v.

       Prison officials, in complying with an order to produce information concerning their remedial plan to address shortcomings in the prison's internal investigation process, could not redact from investigative reports the non-confidential information concerning the conditions of confinement but were allowed to redact and not publish to the public or inmates confidential materials relating to medical, personnel, and criminal history records, and information which, under a reasonable person standard, was necessary to protect the safety of inmates cooperating in the investigation process.

   Freudenthal v. Cheyenne Newspapers, Inc., 2010 WY 80, 233 P.3d 933, <cite class="wy_code">2010 Wyo. LEXIS 83</cite> (Wyo. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deliberative
   process privilege is incorporated into Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t16c04a02s16-4-203ol1bv" target="_self">16-4-203(b)(v)</a></cite> because the privilege is recognized in Wyoming common

      </p>
      <p>
       When asserting
   the deliberative process privilege as a basis for withholding disclosure
   of public documents, the burden remains upon a custodian of the records
   to overcome the presumption in favor of disclosure as to each document
   withheld (or redacted), and the custodian must be prepared to provide
   a written statement of grounds for denial upon request of an applicant,
   with sufficient information to allow the applicant to evaluate the
   basis for denial. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       When asserting
   the deliberative process privilege as a basis for withholding disclosure
   of public documents, a custodian must insure that the decision to
   withhold the records satisfies all prongs of the test: 1) it is an
   interagency or intraagency communication, 2) the communication is
   pre-decisional and deliberative, and 3) disclosure is not in the
   public
   interest. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       First requirement
   of the deliberative process privilege is that a communication be
   between
   employees or officials within an agency or between agencies
   of the
   State. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       For a document
   to be “pre-decisional,” under the deliberative process
   privilege, the document must be one that is generated prior to the
   government's adoption of a policy, so the exemption covers recommendations,
   draft documents, proposals, suggestions, and other subjective documents
   which would inaccurately reflect or prematurely disclose the views
   of the agency, suggesting as agency position that which is as yet
   only a personal position. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       To test if
   disclosure of a document is likely to adversely affect the purposes
   of the deliberative process privilege, courts ask if the document
   is so candid that public disclosure is likely to stifle frank communication
   within an agency, whether the document is recommendatory in nature
   or is a draft of what will become a final document, and whether the
   document is deliberative in nature, weighing the pros and cons of
   agency adoption of one viewpoint or another. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the
   deliberative process privilege, even if a document is predecisional
   at the time the document is prepared, the document can lose that
   status
   if the document is adopted, formally or informally, as an
   agency position
   on an issue or is used by the agency in the agency's
   dealings with
   the public. Aland v. Mead, 2014 WY 83, 327 P.3d 752, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 89</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

       District court properly entered summary judgment in favor of a city in a newspaper's action for an order declaring that a city's employee investment study implementation team must comply with the Wyoming Public Meetings Act because the team was not subject to the Act where, although it was a committee, it was not an “agency” created pursuant to Wyoming constitution, statute, or ordinance, the Act was limited to “meetings of the governing body of an agency,” the team was appropriately created by resolution where its charge was to deal with matters of temporary and special nature, its mandate was to recommend alternatives for the city council to act upon, and its function was of a special and temporary character.

     <p>
      A public body may issue refunding public securities to refund one (1) or more or any part of one (1) or more or all issues of its public securities which are outstanding, and refunding public securities and public securities authorized for any other purposes may be issued separately or issued in combination in one (1) series or more by any issuer except as hereafter provided. No two (2) or more issues or parts of issues of outstanding public securities shall be refunded by a single issue of refunding public securities unless the taxable property upon which tax levies are being made for payment of the outstanding public securities is identical to the taxable property on which the levies are being made for the payment of all other outstanding public securities proposed to be refunded by the single issue of refunding public securities. No two (2) or more issues or parts of issues of outstanding public securities or refunding public securities and public securities authorized for any other purposes shall be combined in one (1) issue where more than one (1) constitutional or statutory debt limitation is applicable to the combination.

      The proceeds of refunding public securities shall either be immediately applied to the retirement of the public securities to be refunded or be placed in escrow in any state or national bank within the state which is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation and which has trust powers, to be applied to the payment of the public securities being refunded upon their presentation. Any accrued interest and any premium appertaining to a sale of refunding public securities may be applied to the payment of the principal and interest, or both may be deposited in a reserve account, or may be used to defray incidental costs, as the governing body may determine. Any escrow shall not be limited to proceeds of refunding public securities, but may include other monies available for its purpose. Any escrowed proceeds, may be invested or reinvested in federal securities. Escrowed proceeds and investments, together with any interest or other yield to be derived from any investment, shall be in an amount at all times sufficient to cover principal, interest, any prior redemption premium due, and any charges of the escrow agent, to pay the public securities being refunded as they become due at their respective maturities or due at designated prior redemption dates in connection with which the governing body of the issuer shall exercise a prior redemption option. The computations made in determining sufficiency shall be verified by a certified public accountant certificated to practice in this state or in any other state. Any purchaser of any refunding public security is not responsible for the application of the proceeds thereof by the issuer or any of its officers, agents or employees.

      Any refunding public security or interest coupon may be signed, countersigned, executed or attested by the public officials who are authorized by law at the time of the issuance of the refunding public securities to sign, countersign, execute or attest public securities of the issuer of the same general character as those public securities and coupons which are being refunded.

The facsimile seal shall have the same legal effect as the impression of the seal. Refunding public securities and any coupons bearing the signatures of officers in office on the date of the signing shall be valid and binding obligations of the issuer, notwithstanding that before the delivery and payment any or all persons whose signatures appear have ceased to fill their respective offices. Any officer authorized to sign, countersign, execute or attest any refunding public security or interest coupon, at the time of its execution or of the execution of a signature certificate, may adopt for his facsimile signature the facsimile signature of his predecessor in office in the event the facsimile signature appears upon the refunding public security or coupons, or upon both the public security and coupons.

Should the tax for the payment of the principal and interest on any refunding public security at any time not be levied or collected in time to meet the payment, or if the refunding public securities are issued at a time which makes it impossible to levy a tax for the initial installments of principal or interest, the principal or interest so maturing shall be paid out of the general fund of the issuer, or from any other funds available for that purpose.

       A dusting pilot engaged in the weed and pest control business, who was denied a spraying contract by a private, nonprofit corporation despite being the lowest resident bidder, did not establish his federal civil rights claim. The private corporation's receipt of substantial amount of public funding from a county weed and pest control district, a public corporation, did not convert its status to that of a public corporation. Thus, the pilot had no more than a unilateral expectation of a statutory preference right under this section, and not a legitimate claim of entitlement, i.e., property right. Wright v.

     Wyoming Preference Act does not violate privileges-and-immunities clause of federal constitution,
   
   notwithstanding its infringement upon the fundamental right to travel to another state for purposes of employment, because it narrowly addresses the goal of reduced unemployment among the state's taxpayers by preferring available, qualified residents for government-funded positions, and thus the degree of discrimination bears a close relation to the state's valid reasons for discriminatory treatment.

    <p>
     Laws 1991, ch. 170, § 2, provides:
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(a)
     </b>
     The Wyoming legislature supports the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 with regard to the need to provide telecommunications access to all of our citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(b)
     </b>
     The legislature finds and declares that many of our citizens are communications impaired and are unable to use traditional telecommunications equipment and services without assistance. These citizens constitute a substantial and valuable resource within the United States and the state of Wyoming and this segment of our population needs access to telecommunications services in order to function as contributing and productive members of our society.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(c)
     </b>
     The legislature further finds and declares that the role of telecommunications in our world today is inestimable. Telecommunications in necessary for the health, safety and well-being of our citizenry, as well as being the primary vehicle of commerce and industry, the means to convey and receive information and knowledge, and the way to connect with others on a personal as well as business level.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(d)
     </b>
     The legislature further finds that access to telecommunications services must be provided to persons who are communications impaired not only for their own sake, but for the benefit of society at large. Access to telecommunications services will enhance the personal and business lives of communications impaired persons and its availability to these persons will be an investment of benefit to all of Wyoming.
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      “(e)
     </b>
     Consistent with the findings stated in this section, the legislature finds it appropriate to provide communications impaired persons access to telecommunications services by creating a program to make specialized telecommunications equipment and message relay services available in the state of Wyoming.”

       Special District Public Records and Meetings Act requires that certain documents be readily accessible for public review and providing options for ensuring that review is possible; the Act does not establish or limit the covered entities’ record retention requirements or disclosure requirements, and it is not a substitute for and does not change the applicability of the Wyoming Public Records Act. Wyo. Jet Ctr., LLC v. Jackson Hole Airport Bd., 2019 WY 6, 432 P.3d 910, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 7</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

      <p>
       While the Special District Public Records and Meetings Act does contain a list of specific documents, what it requires with respect to those documents is that a copy be maintained, and it further directs where and how those copies are to be made available for public review; this amounts to a recognition that certain documents should be readily available for public review, and an acknowledgement that some of the covered entities may not be situated and staffed in a manner to accommodate the required review.
