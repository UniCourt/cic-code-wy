      As a guide to the interpretation and application of the Wyoming Employment Security Law, the public policy of this state is as follows:
      
      <ol type="i">
       <li id="t27c03ol1ai">
        Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals and welfare of the people of this state;
        
       </li>
       <li id="t27c03ol1aii">
        Involuntary unemployment is a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate legislation to prevent its spread and lighten the burden which so often falls with force upon the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this great hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by operating free public employment offices in affiliation with a nationwide system of employment services, by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment. In this way, the purchasing power can be maintained and the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance can be limited;
        
       </li>
       <li id="t27c03ol1aiii">
        The legislature declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of the state require the enactment of this measure under the police power of the state for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves for the use and benefit of unemployed persons.”

         Section 3, ch. 114, Laws 1983, relating to cooperation with other states and the federal government, reads:

        Cooperation with the appropriate agencies of other states and of the federal government in carrying out the Wyoming Employment Security Law as part of a nationwide employment security program; and

         Section 4, ch. 114, Laws 1983, relating to construction, reads: “The Wyoming Employment Security Law shall be liberally construed to accomplish its purpose to promote employment security by increasing opportunities for placement through the maintenance of a system of public employment offices and to provide for the payment of compensation to individuals with respect to their unemployment through the accumulation of reserves.”

      The Unemployment Compensation Act was held not unconstitutional for failure to include all employers on taxable list, particularly for exempting farmers and ranchers. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n v. Renner, 59 Wyo. 437, 143 P.2d 181,

      The Unemployment Compensation Act was held not unconstitutional because it placed burden of providing economic security upon employers only, as distinction exists between employers and employees generally. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n v. Renner, 59 Wyo. 437, 143 P.2d 181,
      <cite class="wy_code">

     <p>
      The Unemployment Compensation Act did not violate art. 1, § 34, Wyo. Const., since the constitutional provision was satisfied by the statute applying uniformly within a class of persons, based on reasonable distinction, or objects of reasonable class, and operating the same in all parts of the state under the same circumstances.

      The Unemployment Compensation Act embraced a group of objects or class of subjects and was not, accordingly, a special, but is a general, law, unless exemption of certain employers made the classification unreasonable. Unemployment Compensation Comm'n v. Renner, 59 Wyo. 437, 143 P.2d 181,

      Former school
      principal was entitled to unemployment insurance benefits because

      should have, instead, immediately pulled a student out of class and
      contacted a staff member to perform an assessment when a school counselor
      reported that the student appeared to be overly tired, the principal's

      Denial of

      because the applicant was fired for misconduct connected with the
      applicant's work in that the applicant intentionally disregarded

The amount shall not be more than the statewide weekly wage multiplied by fifty-five percent (55%) and computed to the next lower multiple of one dollar ($1.00). The statewide weekly wage is the total wages reported by employers, excluding the limitation on the amount of wages subject to contributions under this act, for employment during the calendar year preceding June 1 divided by the product of fifty-two (52) times the twelve (12) month average of the number of employees in the pay period and rounded to the nearest cent.

The pay period reported by employers shall include the twelfth day of each month during the same year.

If the acquiring person is an employer subject to this act, the department shall consolidate the separate accounts and benefit experience and shall determine the contribution rate of the acquiring person effective the first day of the calendar quarter following the date of acquisition. A delinquency rate shall be assumed by the acquiring person as provided in W.S. 27-3-503(b) when the acquiring person owned or controlled an interest in the transferring employer or if the acquiring person is a member of the immediate family of the transferring employer.

The rates of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective the first day of the calendar quarter immediately following the date of the transfer of trade or business.

Instead, the person shall be assigned the applicable new employer rate under W.S. 27-3-503(b). In determining whether the trade or business was acquired solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions, the department shall use objective factors which may include the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continued the business enterprise of the acquired business, how long the business enterprise was continued, or whether a substantial number of new employees were hired for performance of duties unrelated to the business activity conducted prior to acquisition.

      An employer paying contributions under protest may within six (6) months after payment initiate action for recovery against the department in a court of competent jurisdiction. The protest shall be verified and filed at the time payment is made and shall state the grounds for objection. Failure to initiate action within six (6) months is a waiver of recovery under this subsection. Review by the court is limited to the objections stated in the protest. If judgment is for the employer, the amount shall be credited to his account for contributions and interest due under this act. Any remaining balance shall be refunded to the employer from the clearing account.

      In a former employee's claim for unpaid wages, the employer was not entitled to offsets under Wyo. Stat.

      Where the employee is not directed or controlled by an employer who prescribes the hours of work, their number, or the manner or nature of services required, it would offend reason to hold such employees may say they worked 24 hours or any other excessive number of hours each day and then claim a minimum per hour wage.

       Upon receipt of a written claim by any employee of a violation of this act, the director shall process, investigate and determine the validity of the claim. The director shall have power to join various claims against the same employer in one (1) claim. If either the employer or employee is aggrieved by the director’s determination, the aggrieved party may request a fair hearing. The aggrieved party must file a written request for hearing within fifteen (15) calendar days of receipt of the director’s determination. Upon receipt of a timely submitted request for hearing, the director shall appoint an independent hearing officer to conduct the fair hearing between the employer and employee. The fair hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act. The hearing officer’s determination shall constitute the director’s final agency action. Upon a finding by the hearing officer that the claim is valid, the director shall order the employer to pay the amount of wages due plus an additional equal amount as liquidated damages. Where the employer failed to appeal an adverse determination to the district court and failed to comply with the director’s order, the director shall refer the matter to the appropriate county attorney for enforcement of the director’s order.

      Employees of the county assessor, employed as full-time employees, enjoying all the benefits of full-time employees as opposed to part-time employees, and paid as full-time employees for eight hours work per day, although they worked only seven hours a day, were not required to be paid additional money for the extra 20 hours per month they were now required to work.

That, of course, could not be done.

     Employer violated the Act where although the employer demonstrated a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for hiring the new branch manager, under a burden of going forward with the evidence, the employee ultimately established that the employer's explanations of why the new branch manager was more qualified were simply a pretext for handicap discrimination.

      The title to the Fair Employment Practices Act, which reads in part “An act for the establishment of a Wyoming Fair Employment Commission for the investigation and determination of discriminatory and unfair employment practices against persons otherwise qualified because of sex, race, creed, color, national origin or ancestry …,” gives every indication that its purpose is to prevent discriminating practices against females in all employments when they are qualified to hold a position. And where there is a manifest legislative intent that a subsequent general statute shall have universal application, it repeals by implication earlier laws dealing with only a small part of the same subject.

       Summary judgment. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Hearing officer properly granted the employer summary judgment in the 59-year-old employee's age discrimination action arising out of his termination, where evidence failed to counter a supervisor's assertions that at times the employee could not be found at work when he was scheduled to be there and did not change his behavior after being specifically instructed to do so. The employee failed to show that the employer's reason for terminating him was pretextual because, other than the employee's assertion that the supervisor made a discriminatory statement early on in the supervisor's tenure, the employee provided no details about the context or timing of the supervisor's ageist comments, and none of the employee's submissions indicated that the supervisor's remarks were made in connection with his discharge.

       It is the intent of the legislature in creating the Wyoming worker’s compensation division that the laws administered by it to provide a worker’s benefit system be interpreted to assure the quick and efficient delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured and disabled workers at a reasonable cost to the employers who are subject to the Worker’s Compensation Act. It is the specific intent of the legislature that benefit claims cases be decided on their merits and that the common law rule of “liberal construction” based on the supposed “remedial” basis of workers’ benefits legislation shall not apply in these cases. The worker’s benefit system in Wyoming is based on a mutual renunciation of common law rights and defenses by employers and employees alike. Accordingly, the legislature declares that the Worker’s Compensation Act is not remedial in any sense and is not to be given a broad liberal construction in favor of any party.

      Trial court erred when it affirmed a decision denying workers' compensation benefits after an employer refused to reimburse its injured employee for travel expenses after the employee had been injured in a car accident where the trip to deliver a truck belonging to the employer, a truck driving school, was clearly within the scope of employment and it was obvious that the denial of reimbursement for the return trip was solely motivated by the employer's desire to exclude the employee from receiving worker's compensation benefits.

       Neither the district court nor the Wyoming Supreme Court has jurisdiction to consider the constitutionality of a statute; however, the right to pursue the constitutionality of the statute under which the agency acted is preserved in W.R.A.P. 12.12, via a declaratory judgment action. Thus a declaratory judgment was the proper course of action for the employee, an illegal alien who was denied benefits and who challenged the constitutionality of Wyo. Stat.

       Substantial evidence supported the denial of payment for an MRI, because the treatment to appellant's back was not related to the original work injury to his tailbone and was not considered reasonable and necessary medical care pursuant to this section. Although appellant's doctor requested authorization for an MRI to rule out the possibility of a disc herniation, there was no indication in the doctor's notes that he believed a disc herniation was caused by the injury to appellant's tailbone.

       In a worker's compensation case involving “temporary total disability,” the employer did not have the burden of proving that a job offered to the injured employee was one which was suitable and one which the employee could perform. The shifting of the burden of proof under the “odd-lot doctrine” as to the suitability of offered employment was inapplicable, as the employee failed to prove she was so handicapped as to be unemployable in a well-known branch of the labor market.

       A state training school employee who, as she was leaving her home to return a performance evaluation to her employer, tripped on a nail which was protruding from the floor of her porch and fell, aggravating her prior back injury, and also injuring her neck, was not acting within the scope of her employment, as she was not in a place her employer required her to be, or in or about her employer's premises. Also, although the employee contended that her neck injury was compensable because her work-related back injury caused that injury (she claimed that she tripped on the nail and injured her neck because the back injury caused her to drag her feet and because the back injury was her reason for hand delivering the evaluation), there was sufficient evidence to find that her neck injury resulted from the condition of the house and not from her prior medical treatment or prior medical condition.

       An outstanding test as to whether a person is a servant of an employer or not depends on whether the employer has or has not retained the right of control over the party whose status is in question. If he has retained such right of control, the party is generally regarded as a servant. As phases of control or right of control may be mentioned the factors: the place where the work is to be performed, the scope of the work and the control of the premises where the work is required to be done.

        <p>
         The question of responsibility under the Workmen's Compensation Law (now Worker's Compensation Act) for injury during times of rest and the like is one which is indeed difficult and cannot be categorically resolved; but in general it is said that acts necessary to the life, comfort or convenience of an employee while at work are incidental to the service, and an injury occurring while in the performance of such acts may be compensable. Of course, this principle can be applied only restrictively and in the light of facts and circumstances arising in any given instance. Rocky Mountain Tank &amp; Steel Co. v. Rager, 423 P.2d 645,

         Decision by the Office of Administrative Hearings that an employer's
         per diem payments to a worker of $60 per day, that was based on the

         “reimburse[ment] for travel expenses” within the meaning of

         When decedent and his co-employee took a vehicle off the ranch, consumed beer, and then engaged in combat resulting in decedent's death, the incident did not arise out of his employment, but fit within the exception to “injury” found in this section for injuries incurred while engaged in recreational or social events.

       Wyoming Medical Commission properly determined that a workers'

       After appellant was injured in the course and scope of his employment on December 12, 2005, the employer paid for his medical treatment for a short period of time, but fired him because he was unable to work, due to his injury, and then discontinued making such payments on his behalf. When appellant filed for worker's compensation benefits in mid-2006, appellant's self-report of injury was inconsistent with medical evidence showing that he suffered a 2001 back injury; therefore, substantial evidence supported the hearing examiner's conclusion that appellant's back injury was a preexisting condition not related to his work-related injury.

       Hearing examiner's decision to give the claimant's treating physician's opinion little weight was supported by substantial evidence because the physician based his opinion on an incomplete medical history, he was not aware that the claimant had complained of back pain and sought medical attention prior to the 2006 injury, and had been diagnosed with lumbar spine degenerative disease. The physician did not address how the claimant's preexisted degenerative condition might have affected his need for the fusion surgery, nor did he provide a detailed explanation as to why he reached the conclusion that the claimant's back condition was caused by the 2006 work injury.

       Workers' compensation claimant was properly denied permanent total disability benefits under the ‘odd lot’ doctrine after the court concluded that the claimant's inability to continue in his previous employment or obtain work was not attributable to the claimant's workplace injuries and that the Medical Commission correctly applied the odd lot doctrine.

       Claimant was
       not entitled to medical treatment for avascular necrosis (AVN) because
       testimony from a doctor who performed an independent medical evaluation
       of the claimant supported the finding that the claimant's slip and
       fall accident at work did not cause the AVN in the claimant's right
       hip. The treating physician only speculated that the claimant had
       suffered subluxation resulting in AVN, while the doctor provided
       comprehensive
       evidence to a reasonable degree of medical probability
       that the fall
       did not cause the AVN. Stevens v. State ex rel. Dep't of Workforce Servs., Workers' Safety &amp; Comp. Div., 2014 WY 153, 338 P.3d 921,

     <p>
      Where an employee was injured in the month immediately subsequent to the month of hire and prior to the reporting date for the month of hire, the calculation of the three-month grace period allowed by former § 27-12-103(c) for the late payment of contributions began with the next regular reporting date after the injury. As the employer paid the premiums for wages the employee earned in his month of hire well within this three-months' period, plus statutory penalties, he had to be considered as “contributing” to the fund, was not delinquent, and was therefore immune to suit.

       If an employee covered by this act receives an injury under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages, the employee if engaged in work for his employer at the time of the injury is not deprived of any compensation to which he is entitled under this act. He may also pursue his remedy at law against the third party or the coemployee to the extent permitted by W.S. 27-14-104(a). Except as provided by subsections (b), (e) and (f) of this section, if the employee recovers from the third party or the coemployee in any manner including judgment, compromise, settlement or release, the state is entitled to be reimbursed for all payments made, or to be made, to or on behalf of the employee under this act but not to exceed one-third (1/3) of the total proceeds of the recovery without regard to the types of damages alleged in the third-party action. Any recovery by the state shall be reduced pro rata for attorney fees and costs in the same proportion as the employee is liable for fees and costs. All money received by the state under this section shall be credited to the worker’s compensation account and considered in computing the employer’s experience rating.

Service of the complaint on the director and attorney general is a jurisdictional requirement in order to maintain the suit. The director and the attorney general shall be notified in writing by certified mail return receipt requested of any judgment, compromise, settlement or release entered into by an employee. Before offering settlement to an employee, a third party or its insurer shall notify the state of the proposed settlement and give the state fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice in which to object. If notice of proposed settlement is not provided, the state is entitled to initiate an independent action against the third party or its insurer for all payments made to and any amount reserved for or on behalf of the employee under this act. If there is a settlement, compromise or release entered into by the parties in claims against a person other than the employer, the attorney general representing the director shall be made a party in all such negotiations for settlement, compromise or release. The attorney general and the director, for purposes of facilitating compromise and settlement, may in a proper case authorize acceptance by the state of less than the state’s claim for reimbursement. The proceeds of any judgment, settlement, compromise or release are encumbered by a continuing lien in favor of the state to the extent of the total amount of the state’s claim for reimbursement under this section and for all current and future benefits under this act. The lien shall remain in effect until the state is paid the amount authorized under this section. In addition the person paying the settlement remains liable to the state for the state’s claim unless the state through the attorney general signs the release prior to payment of an agreed settlement.

       Meaning of recovery generally. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      What is meant by recovery? This harks back to the phrase “in the event that such employee recovered from such [third] person.” It cannot mean the amount paid to the employee from the former industrial accident fund nor can it mean the amount restored to the former industrial accident fund as a result of a proceeding. The cost of recovery is necessarily the cost incident to the recovery of a judgment in or settlement of a damage action or claim against the third party, for it is only in such an action in which any such cost as 331/3 percent would be involved, and the limitation that not to exceed 331/3 percent of the recovery be deducted from that amount means that 331/3 percent of the amount recovered is the maximum amount which may in any event be deducted from the amounts paid to or on behalf of the employee by the former industrial accident fund rather than that 331/3 percent of the amount paid from the former industrial accident fund be deducted from such payments.

       Remedy for improper charging of experience rating. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      While an employer asserted that it was not afforded notice or an opportunity to be heard before worker compensation benefits were paid to an injured employee, a hearing officer did not have the authority, pursuant to § 27-14-603(e), to remedy the situation by ordering the division to charge benefits to an industrial class as a whole rather than a single employer. Section 27-14-603(e) is not ambiguous and clearly instructs the division, not the office of administrative hearings, to charge benefits against the industrial classification in only one specific situation: where the series of injuries which entitles the employee to benefits does not permit determination of which single employer is to be charged. An adequate remedy for employers who allege division mistakes cause the employer's experience rating to be improperly charged is to petition the division to remove any charges from its experience rating which arose as a result of the division's own neglect, mistake or inadvertence, pursuant to this section.

      The question of whether a property owner is an employer within the meaning of the Worker's Compensation Law is one of law. If an owner of a project is an employer, the employee's sole remedy is worker's compensation and the employee may not subject the owner to a common-law tort action. On the other hand, if the owner is a third party, he is subject to a common-law tort action for the injuries sustained by the contractor's employee. Bence v.

The employer's election not to obtain coverage was not determinative of whether the claimant was entitled to benefits. Kunkle v. State ex rel. Wyo. Workers' Safety &amp; Comp.

      In a case in which the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation Division paid the claimants, who operated air ambulance services in Wyoming, only the amounts permitted by its fee schedule, the Division was required to pay the full amount billed by the claimants because severing the workers’ compensation ambulance provision was consistent with the Wyoming Worker’s Compensation Act’s goal of quick and efficient delivery of medical benefits; as severed, air ambulance charges incurred by an injured worker were covered expenses, and the Division had authority to pay those charges; and, applying the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), the Division was barred by the ADA’s preemption provision from taking unilateral action to reduce the claimants’ rates.

      Where, although a claimant may have known that his 1963 injury was the source of his medical difficulties as early as November 1986, but it was not until May 1988, when so informed by his examining physician, that he became aware that his injury (total disability) had “occurred,” pursuant to subsection (c), the injury occurred when the physician's report was mailed on May 2, 1988.

      Where employee's income varied substantially from month to month the hearing examiner properly averaged employee's income to determine employee's temporary total disability benefits and excluded gratuities that were not reported to the government. However, where employee had worked three and one half months the examiner improperly divided the total income by four months. Goe v. State ex rel. Wyo. Worker's Comp.

      Employee had actual monthly earnings at the time of injury within the meaning of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 27-14-403(c) where the employee had monthly earnings, which did not fluctuate widely from pay period to pay period but were consistent and fixed month after month at a specified hourly rate and number of hours per week, and thus the hearing examiner properly calculated the employee's benefits by applying the formula set out in the division's rules and regulations; answers to any questions about the claimant's work history and the longevity of his employment were speculative and irrelevant to the statutory framework of the worker's compensation law, which focuses on the circumstances at the time of the injury.

The amount of the benefit will be calculated at the temporary total disability rate as determined under W.S. 27-14-403(c) and shall be paid for up to three (3) months until a final compensability decision by a hearing examiner is issued or until the expiration of the period of certified temporary disability, whichever occurs first. The period during which the interim benefit is received shall be included in the time period allowed under W.S. 27-14-404(a). The experience rating of the employer against whom a claim is made shall not be charged for the interim benefit if the injury is determined after hearing not to be compensable. Only one (1) interim benefit under this subsection may be awarded per injury.

       Loss of earning capacity primary consideration in disability compensation. —

     </p>
     <p>
      The concept of disability compensation rests on the premise that the primary consideration is not medical impairment as such, but rather loss of earning capacity related to that impairment. Factors other than medical evidence, such as loss of income in appropriate cases, may be considered in determining the amount of the award. McCarty v. Bear Creek Uranium Co., 694 P.2d 93,

     </p>

      Loss of earnings benefits was premised on claimant's ability to work at a reduced level of functioning, and evidence did not support award where claimant's inability to join the work force was due to his incarceration.

      Injured employee was not entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, where he was given full medical release to return to work as a mechanic and was physically capable of performing his work, but instead sought and accepted lower paying parts department position.

      Evidence supported finding that injured employee voluntarily took a lower paying position, and thus hearing examiner was not required to determine whether employee's pre-injury and post-injury wages were comparable. Sidwell v. State ex rel. Wyoming Worker's Compensation Div., 977 P.2d 60,

     </p>
     <p>
      Hearing examiner did not err by considering the employee's actual post-injury employment even though it commenced after she applied for and was denied permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits and was located in Nebraska because the focus of this section, which sets out the requirements for PPD benefits, was on an injured employee's actual ability to earn, and if the court were to accept the employee's argument that her employment commencing after the filing of an application for PPD benefits could not be considered, employees would have a disincentive to return to work following an injury. Such an interpretation would clearly be inconsistent with this section, which required employees to show they had actively sought suitable work in order to qualify for PPD benefits.

Also, the Commission specifically found that claimant's back condition and impairment were aggravated by the work injury, and that there was no evidence that the claimant was receiving a double recovery because he had never received an impairment rating before the current injury; thus, for purposes of awarding permanent partial impairment benefits, the trial court was correct in not apportioning the claimant's pre-existing condition and his work-related injury.

Stat. Ann. § 27-14-405(h). The employee was given adequate notice of that determinative issue, fully litigated that issue, there was no due process violation, and the OAHs decision was conclusive.

      Permanent partial disability benefits were properly awarded to a claimant because substantial evidence supported hearing examiner's determination that claimant sought suitable work pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 27-14-405(h)(iii) where claimant had registered with the Wyoming Job Network and could describe a number of potential employers whom he had contacted.

      Evidence — Manual for Orthopedic Surgeons in Evaluating Permanent Physical Impairment — supported finding of a permanent partial disability of 20% for a back injury, the only other evidence being the testimony of the employee himself with respect to limitations of function, which testimony was consistent with his medical diagnosis and treatment and not in conflict with the medical evaluation.

      In a workers' compensation case, rejection of the employee's treating physician's impairment rating was proper because independent medical evaluators concluded that the employee's impairment did not involve an alteration of motion segment integrity, as determined by the treating physician, and that a 2% whole person impairment rating was consistent with the employee's medical history.

      Workers' compensation claimant was not entitled to a permanent partial impairment rating greater than 9% whole body because his level of impairment was properly classified as Class 1 under the motion segment lesions grid; a rating made by a physician's assistant did not include an analysis of the dermatomal distribution, and a finding of loss of reflexes was contradicted by other medical records. A report specifically referred to the grade 4 radiculopathy factors when a doctor determined that the impairment fell within Class 1, and the claimant did not offer any medical evidence to show that the doctor's interpretation of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment was incorrect.

      Award of permanent partial disability was proper because a claimant showed a loss of earnings under this section; a back injury rendered the claimant ineligible to return to employment at a paint store, so the fact that the store had closed after the injury was not the cause of loss of earnings and neither was the lack of overtime at a new job.

     <p>
      A claimant was diagnosed as suffering from allergic reactions to substances in his work environment and was treated with salves and lotions through 1984, when a doctor suggested to him that he change work to alleviate some of his symptoms. In 1986, he again sought medical advice, and was ordered to quit working. The district court properly found that the first specific medical enjoinder that the claimant received ordering him to end his job occurred in 1986, and his claim was timely under § 27-14-502(a), was not barred under this section, and was not the result of the claimant's own negligence.

       Time for giving notice of latent injury. —

     <p>
      Where an employee in the course of his employment sustains an apparent trivial injury which does not result in present disability and which would not reasonably be expected to cause future disability, but which injury in fact after a period of latency does cause future disability, the time for giving notice of the occurrence of the injury to the employer runs from the time when it becomes apparent that such injury has resulted in, or is likely to cause, compensable disability.

     <p>
      The fact that the injury notice was given by the employee to the employer 31 hours after attendance at a hospital emergency room, and not within the 24-hour limit, did not preclude an award of benefits, where the employee had worked for two days and then, being unable to continue, had promptly given notice and filed the required reports at the same time he obtained medical attention from an orthopedic physician.

      In order for an employee to have complied with the 20-day (now 10-day) notice provision, she must have filed her notice with the clerk of court within 20 (now 10) days from the time she realized she had a compensable injury. There was substantial evidence to warrant the trial court's finding that the employee, a nurse, first realized she had a compensable injury when a final diagnosis revealed a herniated disk, suffered earlier following the lifting of a patient from his bed.

      A hearing examiner's finding that the claimant did not timely file an injury report with the employer or the workers' safety and compensation division was clearly contrary to the weight of the evidence where the claimant thought that his injury was caused by exposure to a chemical paint stripper, but he was given a nonwork-related diagnosis by several physicians, and the claimant nevertheless diligently pursued medical treatment, and he filed an injury report before he finally received a diagnosis that confirmed his suspicions.

      Employee's filing of three injury reports in 2003 was beyond the period of limitations found in this section because the medical records showed that the employee's self-referral to a doctor in 2002 was to obtain a second opinion concerning the diagnosis of asbestosis that the employee had already received, but even more significant was the fact that the employee filed three injury reports, which were not claims for benefits, and the period of limitations could not have been computed from the date of filing of an injury report; the statutory period passed no matter what date in 2002 was used to determine the commencement of the period, and thus the employee's petition for review should have been dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and the appeal had to be dismissed because the court had no better jurisdiction than did the trial court.

      The law in effect at the time an employee became aware that he was suffering from asbestosis, in December of 1982, was a former version of § 27-12-503, predecessor to this section, which required a claim to be filed within one year after the employee was informed of his injury, or within three years of his last injurious exposure which caused the condition, “whichever occurred first.” Therefore, the employee's claim, filed in June, 1983, was barred, since it had to be brought within three years of the last injurious exposure in 1971, or by 1974. This was so, even though the claim was filed after May 27, 1983, the effective date of the 1983 amendment to that section, which changed the language in what is now subsection (b). Wyoming Ref.

     <p>
      In a workers' compensation case, the Wyoming Office of Administrative
      Hearings had subject matter jurisdiction to hold a contested hearing
      because an employer was the appropriate party to the action; the term
      “person” was broadly defined and included individuals doing business
      under a trade name. An interested party properly objected to the final
      determination of compensability, and an argument that no valid employer
      submitted a valid injury report was rejected.

      Where there was no evidence of fraud on the employer's part, or that employer provided incorrect information to injured worker concerning worker's compensation coverage, employer's failure to timely file an injury report, in and of itself, did not rise to the level of fraud or misrepresentation necessary to invoke equitable estoppel; employer and worker's compensation division were therefore not prevented from asserting statute of limitations as a defense.

      There was

      examiner's conclusion that the proposed treatment of implantation
      of a spinal cord stimulator was causally related to the worker's workplace
      injury, however, there was also substantial evidence to support the
      conclusion that the stimulator was not medically necessary; while
      physicians generally agreed that implantation of a stimulator was
      reasonable treatment, it was not reasonable treatment for the employee
      under these circumstances, as no physician testified as to the resolution

       In a workers' compensation case, benefits were improperly denied to the claimant who suffered back pain occurring over a period of time where the treating physician, even though acknowledging that the claimant's condition had probably been present since adolescence or early adulthood and could be the result of aging, rejected that explanation because of the claimant's age and instead attributed the condition due to the heavy lifting, turning, and bending at a diesel mechanic job, and where claimant denied participating in activities involving snowmobiles, four wheelers, sports, or motorcycles or activities involving any other hazards that would equal his work conditions. By a preponderance of the evidence, the claimant met his statutory burden of proof and, without any evidence that a hazard to which he would have been equally exposed outside of the employment even existed, he had no further burden.

       While an employer asserted that it was not afforded notice or an opportunity to be heard before worker compensation benefits were paid to an injured employee, a hearing officer did not have the authority, pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, to remedy the situation by ordering the division to charge benefits to an industrial class as a whole rather than a single employer. Subsection (e) of this section is not ambiguous and clearly instructs the division, not the office of administrative hearings, to charge benefits against the industrial classification in only one specific situation: where the series of injuries which entitles the employee to benefits does not permit determination of which single employer is to be charged. An adequate remedy for employers who allege division mistakes cause the employer's experience rating to be improperly charged is to petition the division to remove any charges from its experience rating which arose as a result of the division's own neglect, mistake or inadvertence, pursuant to §

While the fact that an employee has filed previous claims and been paid benefits is evidence of successive compensable injuries, there are other ways to prove an employee has suffered those injuries.

       Doctor made an authoritative statement that, while the claimant's 20-years of working for the employer might not have been the only cause of his injury, his employment with the employer was certainly a contributing factor; thus, the hearing examiner's conclusion that the claimant's back problems followed as a natural incident of his work, which involved constant jostling of his spine in the truck cab and heavy labor attendant to the truck driving, was not contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence. Also, there was no error in the hearing examiner's conclusion that the claimant's work for the employer was a proximate cause of his back problems and no hazard outside of his work (smoking, aging, or personal activities) was identified which could have just as well caused the injury; accordingly, the claimant met his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his injuries occurred over a substantial period of time and arose in the course of his employment with the employer.

Certainly he cannot be satisfied in discharging this upon less than the preponderance of believable evidence that the work effort contributed in a material degree to the precipitation, aggravation or acceleration of the existing disease.

      A workers' compensation claimant's application for permanent benefits, after the claimant had received total temporary benefits, was a new claim for benefits that did not entail an increase or decrease in disability, to which this section would apply, but rather a determination as to the permanent effect of the original disability.

      While the legislature has created a vehicle whereby the division, among others, may reopen a case on the grounds of mistake or fraud but has ostensibly limited the remedy available to that of “modification,” no public policy favors the payment of any portion of an unjustified worker's compensation claim. Therefore, the division may petition to reopen a case under subsection (a) for the purpose of terminating worker's compensation benefits originally awarded by mistake or procured by fraud.

      Wyoming Workers'

      benefits in 1990 did not, by itself, satisfy an employee's burden
      of proving that his abdominal pain was related to his 1982 workplace

     </h3>
     <p>
      The director may appeal to the district court from any order or judgment of the hearing examiner awarding compensation or declining to award compensation although he was not a party to the proceedings before the hearing examiner, without the necessity of presenting any petition for reopening of a case to the hearing examiner. After the appeal is perfected, the hearing examiner may stay the execution of the order or judgment appealed from without requiring any bond. The attorney general or his assistant shall represent the director in all cases. All the costs of the new hearings granted upon petition of the director and all costs of appeals conducted by the director shall be paid by the worker’s compensation account except such costs as the court in its discretion shall assess against any of the other parties to the cause.

     <p>
      The district court may appoint an attorney to represent the employee during proceedings in the district court and appeal to the supreme court. The district court may allow the attorney a reasonable fee for his services at the conclusion of the proceedings in district court and the supreme court may allow for reasonable fees for services at the conclusion of the proceedings in the supreme court. In any appeal where the issue is the compensability of an injury, a prevailing employer’s attorney fees shall also be paid according to the order of the district court or supreme court from the worker’s compensation account, not to affect the employer’s experience rating. An award of attorney’s fees shall be for a reasonable number of hours and shall not exceed the benefits at issue in the appeal. In all other cases, if the employer or division prevails in the district court or supreme court, as the case may be, the fees allowed an employee’s attorney shall not affect the employer’s experience rating.

      Wyoming Office of the Medical Commission's decision, that claimant failed in meeting his burden of proof in establishing that his medical treatment after Sept 21, 2001 was directly and causally related to his employment, had no impact on any of his prior claims. The commission decided only those issues referred to it and did not exceed its jurisdiction in considering and deciding claims. Spletzer v. Wyo. ex rel. Wyo. Workers' Safety &amp; Comp.

      In a workers’ compensation case, because an air ambulance company’s interest claim was not addressed in the summary judgment order and therefore was not included in the matter over which the district court acquired jurisdiction, the company’s claim presented an issue separate from but related to the company’s objections referred for hearing, and the Office of Administrative Hearings retained jurisdiction to rule on the interest motion.

      A “medically contested case” is one in which the primary issue requires the application of a medical judgment to complex medical facts or conflicting diagnoses; thus, where the ultimate issue in a case was an issue of law, it was outside the jurisdiction of the Medical Commission.

      Referral to the Wyoming Medical Commission is proper when cases primarily involve medically contested issues, including, but not limited to, those identified in Rules, Regulations and Fee Schedules of the Wyoming Workers'
      Safety and Compensation Division, Chapter 6, § 1 (a)(i)(A)-(D); the fact that the Medical Commission may, in the course of deciding that medical issue, also be asked to consider non-medical issues does not deprive it of authority to decide the case. Therefore, where the primary issue for determination was the medically contested issue of whether a benefits claimant's back problems were caused by a work-related injury, the Medical Commission had authority to decide the case.

      District court erred in affirming the medical commission's determination that employee failed to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that treatment and surgery of her neck and shoulder injury were not related to a preexisting cancer and were related to her work injury where the expert medical testimony adduced before the commission established, without a doubt, that there was a preexisting cancer. However, according to that same expert medical testimony, its only role under the circumstances of this case was to predispose employee to the sort of injury that she suffered while at work.

       The department may upon determining that the issuance of revenue bonds would be financially beneficial to the worker’s compensation account and that bond issuance would not negatively impact employer contribution rates to the account, request the state loan and investment board to issue worker’s compensation revenue bonds to fund awards and claims, program and administrative expenses and program reserves. Upon receipt of a request under this subsection, the state loan and investment board shall review the department’s determination and if it concurs with the determination, the board may issue worker’s compensation revenue bonds in one (1) or more series not to exceed an aggregate amount of two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000.00). The net proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall after payment of issuance costs, be deposited into the worker’s compensation claims payment account established under W.S. 27-14-701(f).

       Revenue bonds issued pursuant to this section are limited obligations payable solely from and secured by funds deposited within the worker’s compensation account as created under W.S. 27-14-701(a) and the worker’s compensation claims payment account. The bondholders may not look to any general or other fund for payment of the bonds except for revenues pledged therefor. The revenue bonds shall not constitute an indebtedness or a debt within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision or limitation. The bonds shall not be considered or held to be general obligations of the state but shall constitute limited obligations of the state and the board shall not pledge the state’s full faith and credit for payment of the bonds. Each series of bonds may be issued by the board at public or private sale, in denominations and registered form, with such provision for conversion or exchange, for establishing interest rates or methods of determining rates on a variable or fixed rate basis, for establishing maturities and redemption provisions, as determined by the board. The bonds shall be payable at the office of a fiscal agent designated by the board. The state loan and investment board shall not issue any revenue bonds under this section unless the sale results in an economic benefit to the worker’s compensation program as determined by the board. In all other respects, the board may prescribe the form and terms of the revenue bonds and shall do whatever is lawful and necessary for their issuance and payment. Action taken by the board under this section shall be approved by a majority of its members.
