      Although son answered to criminal charges in district court, he remained a minor until he reached eighteen, the age of majority, and son's incarceration, standing alone, did not effect an emancipation; father was therefore not entitled to suspension or termination of his child support obligation.

      District court properly denied defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence because he did not met his burden of proving that the statute under which he was sentence was cruel or unusual where he was 18 at the time he committed a double homicide, his sentence to two consecutive life sentences for first-degree murder was effectively a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and the defining the age of majority as 19 did not do so for purposes of determining criminal culpability.

      A child was not emancipated and, therefore, a noncustodial father was not relieved of his support obligation either by the mother's interference with visitation or by the entry of a temporary restraining order, which restrained the father from further contact with his daughter.

      Any minor having a living parent and owning property with income sufficient for his maintenance and education in a manner more expensive than his parent can reasonably afford, regard given to the situation of the parent’s family and to all circumstances of the case, the expenses of the minor’s education and maintenance may be defrayed out of the income of the minor’s own property in whole or in part, as judged reasonable and as directed by the court. The charges for maintenance and education may be allowed accordingly in the settlements of the accounts of the minor’s guardian.

      Supreme court considered a father’s argument that he was deprived of due process in the juvenile proceedings even though it was not raised below because given the close connection between procedures required in the early stages of a child protection action and the cessation of reunification efforts, the issue was of a fundamental nature; however, because the father did not address the issue to the juvenile court, the supreme court’s review was limited to a search for plain error.

      It was not an abuse of discretion to order supervision of a father’s visitation because (1) the father’s statutory right to associate with the children did not apply, (2) the evidence supported findings that the father abused the children, and (3) the evidence supported findings conditioning the father’s unsupervised visitation on the father’s and the children’s therapy.

     A termination of parental rights cannot generally be accomplished by summary judgment after a motion hearing. However, summary judgment is not necessarily precluded in every termination-of-parental-rights case, and the fundamental fairness and propriety of a particular procedure invoked in a termination proceeding may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

      Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure do apply to proceedings for termination of parental rights, and an entry of default can be entered by the clerk against the delinquent parent; however, a default judgment that terminates the rights of the parent cannot be entered by the district court without (1) holding the required hearing; and (2) Wyoming's Department of Family Services presenting clear and convincing evidence of the grounds to terminate the parental rights, all in accordance with the termination of parental rights statutes. If the court finds that a statutory basis for termination has been established by clear and convincing evidence, it can then terminate the parent-child legal relationship.

      control of the mother's children, despite repeated exposure to substance

      Mother was unfit to have custody or control of the mother’s children because the mother admitted that the children were in foster care under the State of Wyoming’s responsibility for well over 15 of the most recent 22 months. Furthermore, the State presented clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of trial, the mother was not able to meet the children’s physical, mental, or emotional needs, as the mother lost contact with the children and could not provide a positive, nurturing, or safe environment for them. 2019 WY 15,

      Termination of a mother's parental rights under this section was not invalidated due to a decision not to place children with their maternal grandmother because the placement decision did not affect the mother's ability to visit the children or strengthen a relationship with them; moreover, that placement was unsuitable due to the grandmother's failure to cooperate and the fact that she lived with a convicted sex offender. In addition, the Wyoming Department of Family Services was not required to wait for a second home evaluation for the grandmother after she moved to a different state before commencing termination proceedings against the mother.

      Termination of the father's parental rights to his children under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 14-2-309(a)(iv) was proper because, while the record was clear that a police report was admitted into evidence, the supreme court did not need to determine whether a clear and unequivocal rule of law was violated because the father failed to prove that, if there was error, it was prejudicial. While the officer's report and testimony certainly informed the district court of the factual background regarding the allegations against father in the criminal case, his report and testimony were not necessary to establish that father was incarcerated due to a felony conviction; the father's own testimony established that to be the case, including that the crime was aggravated sexual assault of a minor.

      Clear and convincing evidence supported the district court's decision to terminate the mother's parental rights under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 14-2-309(a)(v)
      because it was undisputed that the children were in foster care for the 15 months preceding the termination hearing and the evidence tending to show that the mother was unfit was substantial. The evidence showed that: (1) the mother displayed an inability to monitor, to make healthy decisions regarding nutrition, or to provide a safe environment for her children; (2) she had a long-established history of surrounding herself and her children with unsafe individuals; (3) she experienced auditory hallucinations and paranoia; (4) she attempted to commit suicide in front of her children; (5) the children were upset with and resistant to visitation with their mother; and (6) the mother failed to complete various parts of her case plan and often refused to cooperate with service providers.

Rather, the State filed termination proceedings, and the district court granted the petition, on the basis that the children were left in the care of another for at least a year and had been in foster care with the state for over fifteen of the last twenty-months, and the parents were unfit.

     <p>
      Where the father's five children were living in an extremely dirty home, the Wyoming Department of Family Services (DFS) did not provide evidence to connect his marijuana use with his unfitness as a parent; testimony indicated that he was a good father figure, and never used marijuana in the presence of the children. In the termination of parental rights action brought under this section, DFS did not prove by clear and convincing evidence that returning the children to the father would be a risk to their health or safety.

      Even if father had been successful in arguing the insufficiency of the evidence to terminate his parental rights for abuse, the judgment of termination would have to stand because of his conviction of the felony of child abuse, coupled with the clear and convincing evidence that he was an unfit parent by any standard.

      Termination of the mother’s parental rights was proper because the children were in foster care under the responsibility of the State for 50 months at the time of trial; the record was replete with evidence that the mother was unable to meet the needs of the children at the time of trial even during short visits, whether supervised or unsupervised; she tacitly admitted that she was unfit to have custody by arguing that she would have gained fitness at some time in the future if the termination had not occurred; and the mother’s claim that she might improve in the future and become fit to have custody and control of the children was irrelevant to the elements of this section.

      Clear and convincing evidence established that parents were unfit to have custody and control of their child because of the parents’ mental health diagnoses, history of substance abuse, drug-related criminal activity, inconsistent visitation, inconsistent housing, and failure to apply for services and benefits. Termination was also in the child’s best interest because the child had been placed out of the home and the court had no clear indication of when, if ever, the parents would have been sufficiently rehabilitated.

       Commencement of termination proceedings. —
      </b>
      Termination of a mother's parental rights was not invalidated due to a decision not to place children with their maternal grandmother because the placement decision did not affect the mother's ability to visit the children or strengthen a relationship with them; moreover, that placement was unsuitable due to the grandmother's failure to cooperate and the fact that she lived with a convicted sex offender. In addition, the Wyoming Department of Family Services was not required to wait for a second home evaluation for the grandmother after she moved to a different state before commencing termination proceedings against the mother.

      District court exercised sound judgment to deny a mother’s motion to set aside the entry of default because it properly applied the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure and reasonably considered the three factors; the Department of Family Services would be prejudiced by the delay to the permanent placement of the children, and the mother’s failure to respond to the petition to terminate her parental rights for approximately four months constituted culpable conduct that led to her default.

      “Constructive service,” as applied in subsection (b), includes service by publication under Rule 4(e), W.R.C.P., and service for out-of-state residents under Rule 4(l), W.R.C.P. A petitioner has the right to use Rule 4 service of process to satisfy the service requirements of this section only if the procedural requirements delineated in the rule are accurately followed. Therefore, a petitioner's failure to properly conform to Rule 4(l)(2), W.R.C.P., when serving an out-of-state mother by registered mail in a termination proceeding, constituted inadequate service of process.

     <p>
      Even if the district court erred in applying the current version of this section rather than the version that was in effect in 1992 in excluding the testimony of the father's expert disputed two genetic tests determining that he was the child's father, the error was harmless because the father's proffered evidence was insufficient as a matter of law. The first genetic test that determined that the father was not the child's biological father was not simply a problem with the test itself, but rather that samples had been accidentally switched, and those test results were not those of the father, the child, and the child's mother, but rather were the results for three different people; therefore, any expert opinion based on the first test was irrelevant as to whether the father was the child's father.

      Trial court did not commit plain error by admitting the State's expert's testimony regarding Wyoming's statutory paternity presumption where it was admitted to support uncharged misconduct under Wyo. R. Evid. 404(b) and there was no indication that the State relied on the evidence to shift its burden of proof to defendant. The expert testified regarding the presumption only to give context to the laboratory process, she testified that DNA testing showed that defendant was the father of the child victim's baby, three other witnesses testified that defendant was the baby's father, and the victim testified that defendant sexually assaulted her on five different occasions.

     Laws 2004, ch. 44, § 1, provides:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(a) The department of family services shall develop a comprehensive plan to improve the lives and futures of all children and families in Wyoming.

The plan shall:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(i) Consider development of mechanisms to employ the use of public and private resources in an efficient manner to meet the needs of children and families;
    </p>
    
    <p>
     “(ii) Include life span recommendations, including, in particular, prenatal and early childhood intervention and development practices that promote meaningful lifetime changes and minimize delays in life skills development;

     “(iii) Review the current judicial system and make recommendations for reforms that may enable courts to better meet the needs of children and families;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iv) Examine how schools, community organizations, state agencies and the judicial system can work more closely together to enhance a sharing of resources and information to meet the needs of parents, preschool children and elementary and secondary school students;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(v) Examine causes of the most serious problems facing children and families, including poverty, mental health needs, violence, the lack of adequate health care, the use of tobacco and illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol;

The plan shall specifically include recommendations:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(i) For institutionalizing collaboration among state and local agencies and the private sector, including the business and faith community to provide seamless and integrated services in which funding is blended, when appropriate, to support client-centered plans that meet the needs of individual children and families;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(ii) For addressing gaps or deficiencies in services;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iii) For early intervention and other services that seek to strengthen the bond between children and parents and place the primary responsibility for raising children on the family;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iv) For the consolidation of programs or funding sources where appropriate;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(v) For the development of comprehensive, integrated state and community level approaches that will leave no child unsupported in critical aspects of life, particularly from birth through five (5) years of age;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(vi) That will result in more integrated, efficient and effective programs and cost savings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(c) The department shall widely disseminate requests, including through electronic media, for the active participation of private groups and organizations in the development of the plans. Before submitting the preliminary and final plans to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee, the department shall issue drafts of the plans for public review and hold at least one (1) public meeting in a central location in the state to receive public comments on each plan.
    </p>
    <p>

In order to execute this program, the act, in part, directs the district judges' judicial conference to recommend to the board of judicial policy and administration rules and regulations governing standards for the legal representation by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases and for the training of those attorneys. The act, in part, directs the board of judicial policy and administration to adopt rules and regulations governing standards for the legal representation by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases and for the training of those attorneys. The act, in part, directs the supreme court to enter into agreements with the individual counties of the state participating in the program to provide reimbursement for the legal representation of children by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases, and directs the supreme court to provide necessary administrative support for the reimbursement program. No state money appropriated under the act is to be expended in any county unless the county agrees to match, at a minimum, 25% of the state money for the reimbursement of legal representation of children by attorneys in child protection or children in need of supervision cases. In consultation with the board of judicial policy and administration, the supreme court and the individual county are to establish the reimbursement rate within the county for attorneys providing legal representation as guardians ad litem in child protection and children in need of supervision cases. The supreme court is to report each year on or before November 1 to the joint judiciary interim committee and the joint appropriations interim committee on the results of the program authorized by this section, including the number of cases and the amount of monies expended for reimbursements and the amounts of matching monies from participating counties.

      Juvenile court
      did not make an unreasonable decision in denying the grandparents'
      motion seeking to transfer placement of their grandchild from the
      foster parents to the grandparents; the child had been in the foster

      court correctly concluded that the best interests of the child were

      Evidence was
      sufficient to support defendants’ convictions for physically
      abusing the victim because the victim testified that defendant would
      sometimes use the black belt as punishment if the victim did not complete
      his chores, the belt would leave bruises on his bottom, back, and
      legs, and his three siblings testified that both defendants used a
      backscratcher to beat the victim. Larkins v. State, 2018 WY 122, 429 P.3d 28,

      Evidence was

      In a felony
      child abuse case, a district court erred when it failed to instruct
      the jury in the elements instruction of the count relating to the
      victim that physical injury excluded “reasonable corporal punishment”;
      the error was plain because the instructions were confusing as to
      the burden of proof. However, the State was entitled to retry defendant
      because it presented sufficient evidence to support a verdict finding
      that the victim's physical injuries due to getting hit in the ribs
      and slapped in the face were not the result of reasonable corporal
      punishment. Andersen v. State, 2014 WY 88, 330 P.3d 256,

      Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for felony child abuse; defendant used wood to spank the victim, which left abrasions, bruises, and lacerations. Defendant's argument that the injuries were not serious and that he acted reasonably was misplaced; because the State was entitled to all favorable inferences that could have been drawn from the evidence, the jury was free to reject defendant's proffered justifications for the abuse.

       Neglect. —

      In a termination of parental rights case, it was reasonable to conclude that the developmental deficiencies displayed by a child were the result of neglect by his parents; social workers never saw the parents interact with the child, the house was so cluttered and filthy that the child could not roll over if placed on the floor, the child was constantly observed in his stroller, and at the age of one, the child could not hold up his own head, could not crawl, could not talk, and did not know how to use his fingers.

      It was no error to adjudicate a noncustodial father neglectful because Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 14-3-202(a)(i) did not require a parent to have physical custody of a child to be defined as “a person responsible for a child's welfare,” as prior to the use of the first “or” in the statute, the legislature listed categories of individuals who, by fitting into one of those categories, inherently were responsible for a child's welfare whether the child was in their custody or not, as long as a noncustodial parent had knowledge and an opportunity to act and failed or refused to do so, and categories listed after the “or” were broad and had no inherent responsibility towards a child, so the legislature modified those falling into that category by requiring physical custody or control of the child.

      In order for a noncustodial parent—whether he or she lives in a different town, state, or country voluntarily, due to military deployment, or any other reason—to be deemed neglectful of a child, the State must prove that he or she had the knowledge and opportunity to act and he or she failed or refused to do so.

      Evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding of neglect based on the mother's unsanitary and unkempt home because it showed that: (1) the children's food was rotten, and that it came from the dumpsters of nearby grocery stores; (2) there were bloodied cloth rags strewn
      about the upstairs bathroom; (3) there was a foul smell throughout the house; (4) one child's room lacked an apparent heat source and was cold; (5) water leaked from the bathroom into the child's room; (6) dog and cat feces remained on the floors without being cleaned up; and (7) trash and dirty laundry was scattered around the house.

      Counselor was immune from civil or criminal liability for reporting the father's alleged abuse of his son under this section, and therefore her motion for summary judgment was properly granted, because she acted upon a reasonable suspicion and the father failed to rebut the presumption of good faith with his negligence allegations. The evidence showed that the son told the counselor that his father watched him shower and touched his genitals and buttocks while assisting him with his showers. Thomas v.

      Counselor was immune from civil or criminal liability for reporting the father's alleged abuse of his son under this section, and therefore her motion for summary judgment was properly granted, because she acted upon a reasonable suspicion and the father failed to rebut the presumption of good faith with his negligence allegations. The evidence showed that the son told the counselor that his father watched him shower and touched his genitals and buttocks while assisting him with his showers. Thomas v.

       Privilege removed from all evidence regarding child. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The language of this section is definite in removing the named privilege from all evidence “regarding a child”; such language does not restrict application to communications between the child patient or child client and the physician or psychologist, but includes communications between the mother and the physician and psychologist. In re Parental Rights of PP, 648 P.2d 512,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       1982 Wyo. LEXIS 355

      </cite>
      (Wyo. 1998).
     </p>
     <p>
      District court did not err by allowing a mother's mental health providers to testify to privileged communications because the mother was not entitled to reinstate the privilege for information that was previously disclosed pursuant to an “express waiver” of the privilege; even without the express waivers, the evidence was admissible at trial because there was reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the child was being subjected to conditions or circumstances that would result in neglect.

     <p>
      Because a mother's physical and mental state was at the heart of the claim that she neglected her child, information the mother disclosed to her counselors was clearly “evidence regarding a child.” Cave v. State (In re GAC), 2017 WY 65, 396 P.3d 411,

      Trial court did not err in finding neglect under this section where: (1) the mother's daughter was unable to find the mother at home, so the daughter called a bar where the mother was known to frequent, (2) the mother and her boyfriend went to the bar nearly every night and drank, (3) the mother was drunk at the time her daughter called her, (4) the mother's boyfriend threatened the mother's father and the children with physical violence, (5) the children had seen the mother and boyfriend doing drugs, (6) there had been many family arguments and fighting, and (7) the oldest daughter had attempted, or at least threatened, suicide; thus, the circumstances constituted the failure or refusal to provide the adequate care and supervision necessary for the children's well-being.

      Court erred by revoking a consent decree in the neglect case because, although the court did not lose jurisdiction when the court was empowered to conduct a hearing and rule on the accusations, the court erred in concluding that the Mother violated the terms of the consent decree by drinking alcohol when the consent decree agreement did not expressly prohibit Mother from drinking but only required her to undergo alcohol/substance abuse evaluation and follow the regimen of treatment recommended.

      et seq., the Wyoming Child Protection Act, was entered against defendant for not providing adequate care necessary for the well-being of his minor children; the juvenile court ordered defendant to satisfy certain requirements within a specified period of time. Because the contempt proceeding against defendant was not conducted as an independent criminal action apart from the underlying juvenile case as required by Wyo. R. Crim. P. 42(c), with its own caption and docket number, the juvenile court never acquired jurisdiction to proceed; its judgment and sentence of contempt was null and void.

      Juvenile court violated a father’s right to due process because it failed to give him reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard in the child protection action; many of the requirements of the Child Protection Act were not followed because the father was not informed when the child was taken into protective custody or of the shelter care hearing; the father was materially prejudiced by the due process violations because his lack of involvement colored the juvenile court’s ruling.

      Juvenile court violated a father’s right to due process because it failed to give him reasonable notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard in the child protection action; many of the requirements of the Child Protection Act were not followed because the father was not informed when the child was taken into protective custody or of the shelter care hearing; the father was materially prejudiced by the due process violations because his lack of involvement colored the juvenile court’s ruling.

The court found that at the time the neglect petition was filed, the mother was in prison and unable to care for the children, the location of the father was unknown, the children were left with grandparents who could not care for them, and the mother had consented to the neglect disposition. The court also found that upon the mother's release from prison, she allowed the children to ride in a car with the father who was intoxicated and under the influence of drugs, and additionally exposed them to instability due to her lack of employment and housing.

      Court declined to address the merits of whether the State, trial court, or family services department failed to comply with this section, other sections, and various department rules in connection with the alleged lack of formal written reports and written case plan or the delay in setting an adjudicatory hearing because the mother failed to support her grievances with citations to relevant precedent and failed to show how any alleged deficiencies in the trial court prejudiced her; but the court did not retreat from its conviction that the judicial system had to be diligent in protecting parental rights, nor did the court imply that the department or any administrative agency was free to ignore statutes, agency rules, or court orders.DH v.

      District court
      erred in denying a mother's motion to dismiss a consent degree because,
      while the mother's children were returned to her after the appeal
      was filed and the underlying juvenile case had been closed, the motion
      was not moot where it was necessary to provide guidance to state agencies
      and lower courts, the court lacked authority to extend the consent
      decree after it had expired, and the State's failure to initiate action
      within the six-month period specified in the decree deprived the juvenile
      court of any opportunity to modify or extend the decree “for

      After the juvenile court issued an order that authorized removal of neglected children from their mother's custody without a subsequent order, the mother's due process rights were not violated by removing the children without first conducting an evidentiary hearing. She had notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard at the review hearing.

     <p>
      In Wyoming dependency/neglect proceedings, due process requires that if a change in a permanency plan includes adoption or permanent placement other than reunification, parents must have the right to request, and on request must be provided with, an evidentiary hearing, and a parent must request the hearing if he or she desires one, because there may be instances in which parents do not dispute a recommendation or are content with a non-evidentiary hearing, so the failure to request such a hearing waives that right.

     </p>
     <p>
      Hearing on change in goal of a permanency plan from reunification to adoption did not violate a mother's due process rights because (1) the mother did not seek a hearing or directly claim the hearing held violated due process, and (2) lack of a full evidentiary hearing was not plain error, as such a right was not clear at the time of the hearing, since Wyo. R. Evid. 1101(b)(3) said the rules of evidence only applied to juvenile adjudicatory hearings. KC v. State (In the Interest of GC), 2015 WY 73, 351 P.3d 236,

     <p>
      Juvenile court properly changed the permanency plan for a mother's child from family reunification to termination and adoption because, while the delays in holding review hearings were unacceptable and contrary to the child's best interests, the mother waived her due process and other claims relating to the change in permanency from reunification to adoption when she advocated a permanency goal of adoption, the Child Protection Act did not require that the permanency order include findings regarding the merits of prospective adoption applicants or that the order give effect to the mother's adoption preference, and determination of the adoptive parent(s) was a matter for a separate proceeding.

      Termination of a mother's parental rights was not invalidated due to a decision not to place children with their maternal grandmother because the placement decision did not affect the mother's ability to visit the children or strengthen a relationship with them; moreover, that placement was unsuitable due to the grandmother's failure to cooperate and the fact that she lived with a convicted sex offender. In addition, the Wyoming Department of Family Services was not required to wait for a second home evaluation for the grandmother after she moved to a different state before commencing termination proceedings against the mother.

       Jurisdiction.—

     <p>
      Juvenile court’s jurisdiction lapsed on a child’s 18th birthday because the juvenile court made the required findings over three months after the child turned 18; necause the juvenile court’s failure to address the procedural requirement deprived it of jurisdiction over the child, its belated order that its jurisdiction would continue until either an adult guardianship was in place or the child turned 21 was without effect.

      Juvenile court
      did not make an unreasonable decision in denying the grandparents'
      motion seeking to transfer placement of their grandchild from the

      Juvenile court’s order in the prior neglect proceedings was a final, appealable order under the Child Protection Act and the Wyoming Rules of Appellate Procedure, and constituted a judgment, the collateral attack of which generally was disallowed; thus, the mother could not collaterally attack the order in the prior neglect proceedings on appeal under the guise of appealing the district court’s order terminating her parental rights.

      Department of Family Services made reasonable efforts to reunify the family for 20 months, without success; the department’s primary legal obligation was to reunify the existent family, which was with the mother, but she failed to comply with her case plan, and despite the father being in prison with a release date of 2022, the department tried to find a placement for the child within his family. The father had no relationship with the child, and it was in the child’s best interest to change the permanency plan to adoption.

     <p>
      State was not required to show reasonable efforts to reunify the family in a parental rights termination proceeding where there was no requirement for reasonable efforts because the termination was sought on the basis that the children were left in the care of another for at least a year under and had been in foster care with the state for over fifteen of the last twenty-months.

     <p>
      It was not an abuse of discretion to alter a father’s sons’ permanency plan from reunification to termination of parental rights and adoption because sufficient evidence showed the Wyoming Department of Family Services (DFS) made reasonable reunification efforts, but those efforts were unsuccessful when the father (1) refused to cooperate with DFS or utilize rehabilitation programs available to the father while incarcerated, (2) engaged in misconduct limiting the father’s ability to have contact with the sons, and (3) then communicated with the sons only sporadically.

     Laws 2004, ch. 44, § 1, provides:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(a) The department of family services shall develop a comprehensive plan to improve the lives and futures of all children and families in Wyoming. In developing the plan, the department shall collaborate with the business councils of the Northern Arapaho tribe and Eastern Shoshone tribe, state and local agencies, including the department of health, the department of workforce services, the department of employment, the department of education, the department of corrections, the Wyoming business council, the University of Wyoming, Wyoming community colleges, the judiciary and private groups, service providers and businesses, including faith-based organizations and not-for-profit organizations, that express an interest in participating in the development of the plan. The plan shall:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(i) Consider development of mechanisms to employ the use of public and private resources in an efficient manner to meet the needs of children and families;
    </p>
    
    <p>
     “(ii) Include life span recommendations, including, in particular, prenatal and early childhood intervention and development practices that promote meaningful lifetime changes and minimize delays in life skills development;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iii) Review the current judicial system and make recommendations for reforms that may enable courts to better meet the needs of children and families;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iv) Examine how schools, community organizations, state agencies and the judicial system can work more closely together to enhance a sharing of resources and information to meet the needs of parents, preschool children and elementary and secondary school students;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(v) Examine causes of the most serious problems facing children and families, including poverty, mental health needs, violence, the lack of adequate health care, the use of tobacco and illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(vi) Examine issues of parent accountability;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(vii) Encourage and support family stability;

    </p>
    <p>
     “(b) The department of family services shall submit a preliminary plan with recommendations for any initial legislation to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee no later than November 1, 2004. The final plan shall be submitted no later than October 1, 2005. Any recommendations contained in the plan shall be science-based or reflect practices that have a record of success. The plan shall specifically include recommendations:
    </p>
    <p>
     “(i) For institutionalizing collaboration among state and local agencies and the private sector, including the business and faith community to provide seamless and integrated services in which funding is blended, when appropriate, to support client-centered plans that meet the needs of individual children and families;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(ii) For addressing gaps or deficiencies in services;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iii) For early intervention and other services that seek to strengthen the bond between children and parents and place the primary responsibility for raising children on the family;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(iv) For the consolidation of programs or funding sources where appropriate;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(v) For the development of comprehensive, integrated state and community level approaches that will leave no child unsupported in critical aspects of life, particularly from birth through five (5) years of age;
    </p>
    <p>
     “(vi) That will result in more integrated, efficient and effective programs and cost savings.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(c) The department shall widely disseminate requests, including through electronic media, for the active participation of private groups and organizations in the development of the plans. Before submitting the preliminary and final plans to the joint labor, health and social services interim committee, the department shall issue drafts of the plans for public review and hold at least one (1) public meeting in a central location in the state to receive public comments on each plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(d) In addition to the appropriation contained in subsection (e) of this section, the department of family services, the department of health, the department of workforce services, the department of employment, the department of education, the department of corrections, the Wyoming business council, the University of Wyoming, Wyoming community colleges and the judiciary may utilize existing resources and apply for any federal or private grants that may be available to augment funding for the study and plan required under this act. The department may also contract with recognized experts and consultants to conduct the study and develop the plan and recommendations required by this act.
    </p>
    <p>
     “(e) There is appropriated from the general fund to the department of family services two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00) to implement the purposes of this act.”

      Transfer process determinants of confidentiality and burden of proof, as well as the court of jurisdiction, have been uniformly held to constitutionally rest within legislative discretion. The Wyoming legislature has clearly and validly established the courts and transfer processes for the trial of criminal offenses committed by persons under the age of majority. Menapace v.

     <p>
      The statutory scheme is constitutional; there is no demonstrable prejudice arising out of the failure to assign the burden of proof prior to any hearing; and there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in refusing to transfer case to juvenile court or on the part of the trial judge in transferring another case to the county court from juvenile court for a preliminary examination with the view that the case would be prosecuted in the district court.

     <p>
      District court did not err in denying a juvenile defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court because the district court's analysis demonstrated that it exercised the appropriate judicial discretion in denying a transfer to juvenile court; the court thoroughly considered the evidence and argument presented and gave suitable weight to defendant's lack of maturity but ultimately concluded that defendant's diminished problem-solving and critical thinking skills paled in light of the maturity and sophistication exhibited in carrying out the planned burglaries. The district court likewise considered defendant's juvenile history and contact with law enforcement and his failure to complete probation and concluded that, while greater rehabilitative services would be available to defendant through the juvenile court, defendant was an unlikely candidate for rehabilitation.

       At any time after the filing of a petition alleging a child delinquent and before adjudication, the court may issue a consent decree ordering further proceedings held in abeyance and place a delinquent child under the supervision of a probation officer. The placement of the child is subject to the terms, conditions and stipulations agreed to by the parties affected. The consent decree shall not be entered without the consent of the district attorney, the child’s attorney, where applicable, and the child and the notification of the parents. Modifications to an existing consent decree may be allowed.

      <li id="t14c06a02s14-6-228ol1b">

       If prior to discharge by the court or expiration of the consent decree, a child alleged to be delinquent fails to fulfill the terms and conditions of the decree or a new petition is filed alleging the child delinquent because of misconduct occurring during the term of the consent decree, the original petition and proceedings may be reinstated upon order of the court after hearing and the matter may proceed as though the consent decree had never been entered. If, as part of the consent decree, the child made an admission to any of the allegations contained in the original petition, that admission shall be entered only if the court orders that the original petition and proceeding be reinstated and the admissions, if any, be entered. If the admission is entered, the court may proceed to disposition pursuant to W.S.

       “Evaluation and treatment” denotes a single course of action. —

     <p>
      The plain language of the statute reveals that the legislature gave the district courts authority to require that a parent or a child undergo an evaluation and indicated treatment or undergo another program which was designed to rectify the problems which contributed to the adjudication. The phrase “evaluation and indicated treatment” denotes a single course of action. While an evaluation may be imperative in some cases, in other instances an evaluation may not be necessary in order for the district court to determine that a certain program may be beneficial in solving the problems which resulted in the minor's delinquent behavior.

       If an appeal is taken, an order to pay a fine, costs, support for a child, restitution or any order for the payment of money may be stayed by the juvenile court or by the supreme court pending appeal. The court may require the appellant to deposit with the clerk of court the whole or any part of the payment ordered, to give bond for the payment thereof or any other terms and conditions to secure payment upon final determination of the appeal as the court deems proper. The court may also issue any appropriate order to restrain the appellant from dissipating his assets pending appeal.

       Either the juvenile court or the supreme court may stay an order transferring legal custody of a child to a person, agency, organization or institution other than his parents, guardian or former custodian, provided that suitable provision is made for the detention or shelter care of the child pending the appeal.

      The district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a 15-year-old sexual assault defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court, given the fact that the defendant had established himself as an independent, emancipated individual, living and working on his own, and given the serious nature of the crime. Rubio v. State, 939 P.2d 238,
      <cite class="wy_code">

      (Wyo. 1997).
     </p>
     <p>
      District court did not err in denying a juvenile defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court because the district court's analysis demonstrated that it exercised the appropriate judicial discretion in denying a transfer to juvenile court; the court thoroughly considered the evidence and argument presented and gave suitable weight to defendant's lack of maturity but ultimately concluded that defendant's diminished problem-solving and critical thinking skills paled in light of the maturity and sophistication exhibited in carrying out the planned burglaries. The district court likewise considered defendant's juvenile history and contact with law enforcement and his failure to complete probation and concluded that, while greater rehabilitative services would be available to defendant through the juvenile court, defendant was an unlikely candidate for rehabilitation.

      District court
      did not err in denying defendant's motion to transfer defendant's
      case, in which defendant was charged with murder and other felonies,
      to juvenile court because the district court (1) thoroughly reviewed
      the relevant statutory factors, and (2) considered defendant's immaturity
      and potential for rehabilitation, which were outweighed by defendant's
      criminal history and the nature and severity of defendant's alleged
      crimes.

     , or termination of parental rights actions brought as a result of a child protection or children in need of supervision action. In order to execute this program, the act, in part, directs the district judges' judicial conference to recommend to the board of judicial policy and administration rules and regulations governing standards for the legal representation by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases and for the training of those attorneys. The act, in part, directs the board of judicial policy and administration to adopt rules and regulations governing standards for the legal representation by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases and for the training of those attorneys. The act, in part, directs the supreme court to enter into agreements with the individual counties of the state participating in the program to provide reimbursement for the legal representation of children by attorneys as guardians ad litem in child protection or children in need of supervision cases, and directs the supreme court to provide necessary administrative support for the reimbursement program. No state money appropriated under the act is to be expended in any county unless the county agrees to match, at a minimum, 25% of the state money for the reimbursement of legal representation of children by attorneys in child protection or children in need of supervision cases. In consultation with the board of judicial policy and administration, the supreme court and the individual county are to establish the reimbursement rate within the county for attorneys providing legal representation as guardians ad litem in child protection and children in need of supervision cases. The supreme court is to report each year on or before November 1 to the joint judiciary interim committee and the joint appropriations interim committee on the results of the program authorized by this section, including the number of cases and the amount of monies expended for reimbursements and the amounts of matching monies from participating counties.

If, as part of the consent decree, the child made an admission to any of the allegations contained in the original petition, that admission shall be entered only if the court orders that the original petition and proceeding be reinstated and the admissions, if any, be entered.

      Order that the juvenile remain in the custody of the Department of Family Services and on probation until he turned 18 was improper the plain statutory language required that all Child in Need of Supervision (CHINS) orders terminate when an adjudicated child reached 17; thus, the juvenile court therefore did not have the authority to issue a CHINS order that imposed conditions beyond the juvenile's 17th birthday.

     <p>
      Any person adjudicated in need of supervision under the provisions of this act may petition the court for the expungement of his record in the juvenile court upon reaching the age of majority. If after investigation the court finds that the petitioner has not been convicted of a felony since adjudication, that no proceeding involving a felony is pending or being instituted against the petitioner and the rehabilitation of the petitioner has been attained to the satisfaction of the court or the prosecuting attorney, it shall order expunged all records in any format including electronic records in the custody of the court or any agency or official, pertaining to the petitioner’s case. Copies of the order shall be sent to each agency or official named in the order. Upon entry of an order the proceedings in the petitioner’s case are deemed never to have occurred and the petitioner may reply accordingly upon any inquiry in the matter. Expungement pursuant to this section shall be accomplished as provided in W.S.
