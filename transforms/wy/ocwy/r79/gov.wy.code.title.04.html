      <p>
       Where there is no conflict of interest between the beneficiary and the trustee or between beneficiaries, the trustee may sue and be sued in actions dealing with trust property without joining the beneficiary. Spratt v. Security Bank, 654 P.2d 130, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 410</cite> (Wyo. 1982).

        Beneficiaries may terminate trust where no material purpose remaining. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In Wyoming beneficiaries can direct the termination of a trust where there are no remaining material purposes of the trust. American Nat'l Bank v. Miller, 899 P.2d 1337, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 129</cite> (Wyo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The law should guard and enforce a grantor's wishes and purposes, so long as they remain unfulfilled. When those purposes have been fulfilled, however, the law should provide for the most expeditious termination and distribution of the trust estate. American Nat'l Bank v. Miller, 899 P.2d 1337, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 129</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

An organization exercises reasonable diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the employee having responsibility to act for the trust and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Reasonable diligence does not require an employee of the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual’s regular duties or the individual knows a matter involving the trust would be materially affected by the information.

      If, in any action brought against a trustee of a qualified spendthrift trust, a court takes any action whereby the court declines to apply the law of this state in determining the validity, construction or administration of the trust, or the effect of a spendthrift provision thereof, the trustee may immediately resign without the further order of any court, and cease in all respects to be trustee of the trust. In the event that the trustee does resign and no provision for a successor trustee exists in the trust instrument, the qualified beneficiaries may then petition a Wyoming district court with appropriate jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee who shall succeed as trustee upon such terms and conditions as the district court determines to be consistent with the purposes of the trust and this act. Upon the trustee’s ceasing to be trustee, the trustee shall have no power or authority other than to convey the trust property to the successor trustee named in the trust instrument or appointed by the district court.

       District court did not err in affirmatively answering the discrete legal question that the trustee had the general authority to decant trust property under this section and the trust agreement; however, the district court went beyond the discrete legal question presented and erred in resolving disputed issues of material fact concerning the appropriateness of the proposed decanting on a motion for judgment on the pleadings because the trust creator’s intent and the trust’s purpose were material in deciding the appropriateness of the proposed decanting, and a trust beneficiary disputed whether the proposed decanting was consistent with either.

        Removal of Trustee.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of
   trustees from a Massachusetts business trust that was formed to manage
   a family's ranch property was not warranted because, although the
   trustees breached their duty of loyalty to the extent that they engaged
   in self-dealing with the trust, the evidence did not demonstrate that
   they acted dishonestly or with want of capacity, or that any serious
   harm was done. Forbes v. Forbes, 2015 WY 13, 341 P.3d 1041, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error to remove a trustee because the trustee breached the trustee's duty of loyalty by (1) making a loan to a beneficiary with a poor repayment history while calling loans made to beneficiaries who made regular payments, (2) overpaying herself, and (3) delaying a gift to a beneficiary, showing a lack of impartiality in administering the trust.
