    Laws 1978, ch. 22, § 1, revised this title, amending and renumbering §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c01s10-1-101" target="_self">10-1-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c06s10-6-104" target="_self">10-6-104</a></cite> as §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c01s10-1-101" target="_self">10-1-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t10c06s10-6-104" target="_self">10-6-104</a></cite>. No detailed explanation of the changes made by the 1978 Act has been attempted, but, where appropriate, historical citations to former provisions have been added to corresponding sections in this title, and annotations from cases decided under former provisions have been placed under comparable sections in this title where it was felt they will be helpful.

   <p>
    Laws 1978, ch. 22, § 2, provides: “Any other act adopted by the Wyoming legislature during the same session which this act is adopted shall be given precedence and shall prevail over the amendments in this act to the extent that such acts are in conflict herewith.”

       The Wyoming aeronautics commission may enter into agreements to provide financial assistance to persons doing business or who will do business in the state, to economic development organizations within the state, to joint powers boards or to other entities formed to provide for enhanced air service to communities in Wyoming that have or are seeking commercial air service, for the enhancement of air services in the state conditioned upon contractual assurances that specified benefits will accrue to the state through increased air traffic and enplanements. For purposes of this article, “enhanced air service” shall include, but not be limited to, assisting airports in the state with commercial air service to have the appropriate level of state or federal security configuration to accommodate proposed air service and aircraft capacity. When entering into an agreement the commission shall give consideration to each of the following potential benefits accruing to the state: increasing the minimum number of enplanements at airports facing a possible loss of federal airport improvement program funding, increasing passenger enplanements at commercial airports in Wyoming, increasing the number of Wyoming passengers originating flights in Wyoming commercial airports rather than airports in other states, increasing frequency or sustaining flight operations from commercial airports in Wyoming to regional airport hubs, increasing the consistency of service, and lowering airfares in Wyoming communities as a result of an air service enhancement grant. The commission shall consult with counties, cities, towns, joint powers boards, airport boards or other entities pursuing air service enhancement before entering into agreements to provide air service enhancement and shall require local funds for the provision of air service enhancement grants. The amount of local funds required for the provision of enhancing air services shall be determined by the commission, taking into account the types of service for which grants are approved, the diverse characteristics of the communities to which air service is contracted for and other considerations examined by the commission.

        Airplane overflight, without impact on surface, not “taking”of property. —

      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact of airplane overflight, without evidence of impact on the surface (i.e., substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of the surface), did not create a constitutional claim against either the city or its airport board, which adopted an ordinance providing a height limitation in a noninstrument approach zone to the airport, for the “taking” of property through the creation of a flight easement. In addition, the flight easement utilized by airplanes was not created by the passage of the ordinance, but by federal and state declarations of public navigability and by repeated overflights which preceded the home owner's action by considerably more than the 10 years allowed by the applicable statute of limitations (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c03s1-3-103" target="_blank">1-3-103</a></cite>).

       A city ordinance providing a height limitation in a noninstrument approach zone to an airport was an exercise of the police power, and certain homeowners who had a tree in violation of this limitation, who were notified they would have to trim it, and who challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance, failed to demonstrate such a significant impact on their plot as a whole as to counter balance the significant public interest in protecting the airport flight path.
