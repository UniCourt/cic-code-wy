       The original Wyoming Probate Code (ch. 70, Laws 1890-91) was derived from the laws of California. The law which Wyoming adopted was repealed by California in 1931 (Stats. 1931, p. 687), with the exception of § 1723, which was repealed in 1939 (Stats. 1939, p. 1874). However, since much of the former code was reenacted verbatim or in a modified form by California, references, where pertinent, have been retained throughout title 2 to the current provisions of the California Probate Code (Deering 1974). See also catchline “Weight of California decisions” in notes to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c01a01s2-1-102" target="_self">2-1-102</a></cite>.

        History and disposition of original Probate Code. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The original Probate Code in Wyoming was enacted by ch. 70, Laws 1890-91, which was subdivided into 28 chapters. These chapters have since been redesignated as articles and are reflected as such in the historical citations to the statutes and in the notes. Much of the original code is still in effect, although there has also been a considerable amount of subsequent legislation enacted affecting it, particularly ch. 142, Laws 1979, as amended by ch. 54, Laws 1980, which enacts the present Wyoming Probate Code. Moreover, some statutes relating to probate matters which existed prior to the 1890-91 enactment of the original Probate Code are still in effect as well and have been included in the present Wyoming Probate Code.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following table shows the disposition of those provisions of the original Probate Code, ch. 70, Laws 1890-91, divided into articles, as originally enacted, which are still in effect and continue to be a part of the present Wyoming Probate Code or other titles in the 1977 Wyoming Statutes:

   provision must be interpreted in light of the stated overall goals
   of simplicity, clarity, speed, and efficiency, and the doctrine of
   equitable adoption is anything but simple, clear, or speedy in application;
   Wyoming does not recognize the doctrine of equitable adoption. Therefore,
   a claimant was unable to recover from a decedent, who was not her
   biological father; the decedent could have adopted the claimant or
   provided for her in his will, but did neither. In re Estate of Ronald, 2014 WY 129, 336 P.3d 129, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 146</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

      <p>
       After decedent died, the applicants filed an application for decree of distribution under the summary procedures applicable to estates valued at less than $150,000 and the district court entered summary judgment and a decree of distribution; because no trial was held, appellant grandson's motion for new trial was inappropriate. While the grandson's motion for new trial claimed that the estate should not have been settled by summary disposition because it was valued at more than $150,000, the grandson made no showing that the evidence pertaining to the value of the estate could not have been provided during the summary judgment proceeding.

       District court
   erred in ruling that this section, which was amended in 2015, did
   not authorize summary distribution of real property located in other
   Wyoming counties. By removing language directing that an application
   for summary distribution be filed in the district court of the county
   where the property is situated, the legislature clearly indicated
   its intention that the statute authorizes a district court to order
   summary distribution of real property throughout the state. In re Estate of Coborn, 2015 WY 89, 352 P.3d 271, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

      The district courts of the state have exclusive original jurisdiction of all matters relating to the probate and contest of wills and testaments, the granting of letters testamentary and of administration, and the settlement and distribution of decedents’ estates. The court granting the letters has exclusive jurisdiction of all matters touching the settlement and distribution of the estates for which letters have been granted. The jurisdiction over subject matter of the district court sitting in probate, sometimes referred to in this Title 2 as the “probate court”, is coextensive with the jurisdiction over subject matter of the district court in any civil action. A decree of distribution entered by the district court in probate, pursuant to W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a08s2-7-807" target="_self">2-7-807</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a08s2-7-813" target="_self">2-7-813</a></cite>, shall be a final determination of title as to assets described therein, as to all distributees served with notice, or who have waived notice, of the hearing provided for in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a08s2-7-807" target="_self">2-7-807</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a08s2-7-811" target="_self">2-7-811</a></cite>, as the case may be. As to all other parties, an action may be brought and maintained at any time prior to the entry of final decree of distribution under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a08s2-7-813" target="_self">2-7-813</a></cite>, by or against the personal representative in the district court, sitting in probate, seeking any legal or equitable remedy as to any interest in property, real or personal, in which the estate asserts or claims any interest. In addition, all causes cognizable in the district court in any civil action may be brought and maintained, at any time prior to the entry of final decree of distribution under W.S. 2-7-813, by or against a personal representative in the district court sitting in probate which granted the letters to the personal representative.

       Although the probate court never entered an order discharging the personal representative, the court's “Order Approving Final Report and Accounting, and Decree of Distribution” was a final appealable order as a matter of law, and was therefore not interlocutory in nature. There was no appeal from the decree, and it was final unless it was void. Jubie v. Dahlke (In re Estate of Dahlke), 2014 WY 29, 319 P.3d 116, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo.

       This section is all-inclusive and creates a conclusive presumption that all notices required by law have been published for the times and in the manner required by law. That includes notices which are jurisdictional — that is to say, notices which are essential in order to constitute due process of law — and in that respect, the section considered as a curative act cannot be upheld.

      <p>
       In view of the fact that the legislature of Wyoming undertook to legislate in this section as to all notices in probate proceedings, there is no reason to think that it would not have validated proceedings insofar as they are nonjurisdictional. Addison v. Fleenor, 65 Wyo. 119, 196 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

      <p>
       Notice to creditors and notice to set aside homestead
   
   would be jurisdictional, unless they were nonjurisdictional because the court already had jurisdiction of, or against, the parties and of the subject matter by reason of some notice in the probate proceeding previously given. Addison v. Fleenor, 65 Wyo. 119, 196 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

       Since the provisions of §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c04a02s2-4-211" target="_self">2-4-211</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c04a02s2-4-212" target="_self">2-4-212</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a07s2-7-703" target="_self">2-7-703</a></cite> contemplate that claims of an estate shall be presented promptly and may be filed before notice to creditors is given, and since claims of creditors are barred by the general statute of limitations of not more than 10 years, the curative provisions of this section do not invade any constitutional rights in connection with such claims where there was a failure to give notice to creditors which was not jurisdictional. Addison v. Fleenor, 65 Wyo. 119, 196 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

       Where a failure to give notice of the setting off of a homestead was not jurisdictional, that failure could be healed by the curative provisions of this section. Addison v. Fleenor, 65 Wyo. 119, 196 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

All orders, judgments and decrees of the court shall be entered at length in the proper journal of the court. When a judgment or decree is made setting apart a homestead, confirming a sale, making a distribution of real property, or determining any other matter affecting the title to real property, a certified copy shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the property is situated.

      At or before the hearing of petitions and contests for the probate of wills, for letters testamentary or of administration, for sales of real estate and confirmation thereof, settlements, partitions, and distribution of estates, setting apart homesteads, and all other proceedings where all the parties interested in the estate are required to be notified, the court may appoint an attorney-at-law to represent the devisees, legatees, heirs or creditors of the decedent who are minors and have no general guardian in the county, or who are nonresidents of the state, and those interested who, though they are neither minors or nonresidents, are unrepresented. The order shall specify the names of the parties, so far as known, for whom the attorney is appointed. The attorney may receive a fee, to be fixed by the court, for his services, which shall be paid out of the funds of the estate as necessary expenses of administration, and upon distribution may be charged to the party represented by the attorney. If, for any cause, it becomes necessary, the court may substitute another attorney for the one first appointed, in which case the fee shall be proportionately divided. The failure to appoint an attorney will not affect the validity of any of the proceedings.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any personal representative may, by writing filed in the district court, resign his appointment at any time, having first settled his accounts and delivered up all the estate to the person appointed to receive the same. If by reason of any delays in such settlement and delivery of the estate or for any other cause the circumstances of the estate or the rights of those interested therein require it, the court may, before settlement of accounts and delivering up of the estate is completed, revoke the letters of the personal representative, and appoint another personal representative, either special or general, in the same manner as for original letters of administration. The personal representative discharged and released, and the sureties on his bonds are not responsible for any act or liability incurred after his discharge, but shall not be relieved of any liability occurring on his bonds prior to his discharge.

Leases may be for primary terms of five (5) years or less as mutually agreed by the parties thereto and for so long thereafter as the mineral content, including but not restricted to oil, gas or other hydrocarbons, shall or can be produced in commercial quantities from the leasehold premises, or for the term of each unit or cooperative agreement to which the lease may be committed with the consent and approval of the court. The lease is not invalid or voidable because its effectiveness may or will extend beyond the term in office of the lessor, trustee, executor, administrator or guardian, or beyond the time of final settlement of the probate estate, or beyond the minority of the minor or the period of incompetency of the incompetent involved. With the consent and approval of the court any royalty, overriding royalty or other mineral interest or a lease may be committed to a unit or cooperative agreement, or to a secondary recovery agreement, for a like term and with like effect.

A court shall not determine that a fiduciary abused its discretion merely because the court would have exercised the discretion in a different manner or would not have exercised the discretion.

If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts upon which the fiduciary relies, and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.

       The qualifications of an administrator are the same as those of an executor, with one exception. The administrator must be a bona fide resident of the state. Rice v. Tilton, 13 Wyo. 420, 80 P. 828, <cite class="wy_code">1905 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1905).

       A person is not incompetent to serve as administrator with the will annexed unless he comes within one or more of the grounds of incompetency specified in this section. Rice v. Tilton, 13 Wyo. 420, 80 P. 828, <cite class="wy_code">1905 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1905).

       Adverse claim made by person would not render him incompetent
   
   to be an administrator with the will annexed. The bond of the administrator with the will annexed affords ample protection to devisees, legatees and others interested in the estate. Rice v. Tilton, 13 Wyo. 420, 80 P. 828, <cite class="wy_code">1905 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1905).

     <p>
      If the letters are not issued within the time specified, all claims of creditors are forever barred and the purchasers of the property of the decedent from the heirs of the decedent shall take the title free from any claim of creditors. This act does not affect the lien upon encumbered property secured by valid mortgage or deed of trust in the case of real property, or by security agreement or interest valid under the Wyoming Uniform Commercial Code, but the secured creditor is not entitled to any deficiency judgment.

      <p>
       This section is a curative act in that it purports to give legal effect to conveyances from heirs to purchasers of estate properties in cases where letters have not been issued within two years from date of decedent's death. Kuntz v. Kinne, 395 P.2d 286, <cite class="wy_code">1964 Wyo. LEXIS 119</cite> (Wyo. 1964).

      <p>
       As a curative act, the words “shall (now “are”) be forever barred” may be unnecessary and surplusage; but as an act of limitation, they are essential, and their use indicates a positive legislative intent to bar creditors' claims after the lapse of two years following a debtor's death in cases where there has been no probate.

     <p>
      The meaning and legal effect of a disposition in a will is determined by the law of the state in which the will was executed, unless the will otherwise provides or unless the application of that law is contrary to the public policy of this state otherwise applicable to the disposition.

       When determining the validity of a codicil executed in another state by a Wyoming resident, Wyoming courts will apply the law of Wyoming unless the execution did not conform to the requirements of this title; only then will Wyoming courts be justified in turning to the law of the place where the codicil was executed.

       In considering a will, the intent of the testator must govern, and the court can only determine testator's intent from what the will says. Dainton v. Watson, 658 P.2d 79, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 283</cite> (Wyo. 1983).

       In a challenge to a will, the court held that the language of the will was apparent and unambiguously reflected the testatrix's intent that the stock held solely in her name, located in the safety deposit box, be distributed to the sister, and did not reflect an intention that the stocks were to pass under the residuary clause.

The probate court properly found that the April 16, 1982 date was a mistake on the part of the draftsman of the will and not that of the testator, a mistake which would have made a distribution other than in accordance with the expressed distributive intention of the testator as determined from the codicil itself.

No subscribing witness to any will can derive any benefit therefrom unless there are two (2) disinterested and competent witnesses to the same, but if without a will the witness would be entitled to any portion of the testator’s estate, the witness may still receive the portion to the extent and value of the amount devised.

     </h3>
     <p>
      If after executing a will the testator is divorced or his marriage annulled, the divorce or annulment revokes any disposition or appointment of property made by the will to the former spouse, any provision conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse, and any nomination of the former spouse as executor, trustee, conservator or guardian, unless the will expressly provides otherwise. Property prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by divorce or annulment passes as if the former spouse failed to survive the decedent, and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the spouse failed to survive the decedent. If provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by testator’s remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this section, divorce or annulment means any divorce or annulment which would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a will.

       The preference as to letters of administration given by this section to nonresidents named as executors is forfeited by failing to apply for probate of a foreign will and for letters testamentary within the time fixed by this section.

       Where person named in will does not apply for letters of administration within time fixed by statute, he waives the right, and thereafter it is a matter of discretion of the court as to his appointment or appointment of some other person. Rice v. Tilton, 13 Wyo. 420, 80 P. 828, <cite class="wy_code">1905 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1905).
      </p>
      <p>
       Persons designated by the testator to be executors are not rendered incompetent by their delay, but simply lose their preference right, and it then becomes at least a matter for the exercise of sound discretion by the court; and, unless there is an abuse of the discretion by the judge of the court, his judgment should not be disturbed.

       Prompt and immediate administration of estates is matter of special public policy clearly manifest in statutes of this state and by the very fact that wills must be contested under this section within a limited time, which has been reduced by the legislature.

        Section modifies common law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       At common law the appointment of one's debtor as executor was held to extinguish the debt. Since a man could not give his property away to the prejudice of his creditors, it was further held that, if necessary for the payment of the debts of the testator, the antecedent debt of an executor could be reached in equity. But the main rule was early disapproved in the United States, and statutes were enacted in many jurisdictions to abolish it. That situation is true in Wyoming, which enacted this section. State Use of Frederick v. Allen, 42 Wyo. 290, 42 Wyo. 296, 294 P. 681, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 53</cite> (Wyo. 1930).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section was enacted for the sole purpose of changing the common-law rule as to an executor-debtor and to make certain that the common-law rule controlling administrators and other trustees, whereby the assets would be available to the persons entitled thereto, would be applied to executors.

       Person who was appointed to administer a decedent's estate established that she had liquidated damages in the amount of $ 74,071 against a Chapter 13 debtor who was originally appointed to administer the decedent's estate, and that she was entitled to seek twice that amount under Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a04s2-7-411" target="_self">2-7-411</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c07a04s2-7-413ol1b" target="_self">2-7-413(b)</a></cite> based on her claim that the debtor stole money from the estate, and when the resulting amount of $ 148,143 was added to the figure of $ 184,456 the debtor and another debtor claimed as unsecured debt, the sum exceeded the threshold amount set by 11 U.S.C.S. § 109(e) for obtaining relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. As such, the bankruptcy court erred when it overruled the administrator's objection to the debtors'
   plan for paying their creditors.

       An executor has the right to make payments to his decedent's widow for her support without an order of the court after the return of the inventory, and the only question is as to whether the amount paid by him is reasonable. That question is largely in the discretion of the trial court. In re Estate of Dixon, 73 Wyo. 236, 278 P.2d 258, <cite class="wy_code">1954 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1954).

      <p>
       Where a widow's allowance made under this section was continued after inventory without order of court, it was held that the court should have made her an allowance from the date of death to the time when the executor reported the sale of certain property of the estate and that he had paid a portion of the proceeds to the widow and asked that the widow's allowance be discontinued. Payments made after such objection by the executor were made by mistake, and the widow was not chargeable with interest thereon until discovery of the mistake, that is, until a court determined by final decree what was a reasonable allowance.

     <p>
      When any resident of this state dies leaving a spouse or minor children, the court shall set over to the spouse, and if none to the minor children, as their absolute property, all property of the decedent exempt from execution under the exemption laws of this state including the homestead. Such property shall not be subject to the payment of debts of the decedent, except expenses of administration or funeral expenses of the decedent in cases in which there is not other property in the estate sufficient to pay the expenses. If [the] decedent does not have any or all of the property specified under the exemption laws, the spouse or minor children are entitled to the value of the exempt property either in money or other property as they may prefer. If the surviving spouse is not the parent of all or any minor children, one-half (1/2) of the property shall be set over to the surviving spouse and the other one-half (1/2) to the minors who are not children of the survivor. A conservator shall be appointed for the children as in any other cases of estate property descending to a minor. The right of a surviving spouse to any of the exempt property is not affected by his or her renouncing or failing to renounce the benefit of the provisions made for him or her in the will of the decedent.

       Where it was contended that this entire section was void because language of the 1943 amendment commencing “Provided that” and ending “minor” conflicted with the first part of the section, the contention was held untenable since that language was the last expression of the legislative will and it would be given effect under the rule that, where particular provisions conflict with general provisions, the particular would govern.

       There can be little doubt that the statutory proviso, “a widow residing in this territory,” was of persuasive force in the decision reached in Ullman v. Abbott, 10 Wyo. 97, 67 P. 467, <cite class="wy_code">1902 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (1902). However, such proviso is no longer found. It was eliminated by ch. 28, Laws 1919, and in its stead this section now provides in part that, “when any resident of this state dies leaving a widower or widow (now “spouse”) …,” he or she shall be entitled to receive substantially the same benefits conferred by the former statute. The shift of the residence requirement from the surviving spouse to the decedent is indeed significant. Stolldorf v. Stolldorf, 384 P.2d 969, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo.

      <p>
       That this section does not contemplate a probate homestead different from the homestead contemplated under the exemption laws is apparent in two ways. First, it is not primarily a “homestead” as such which the statute authorizes to be set over; it is all property of the decedent “exempt from execution,” including the homestead. Second, the value of the homestead referred to in this section is not fixed in the Probate Code; it is fixed in the exemption laws by § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c20s1-20-101" target="_blank">1-20-101</a></cite>.Wambeke v.

       A probate judge necessarily turns to the exemption laws to find what, if any, property is to be set over pursuant to the provisions of this section and to find the value thereof when money or other property is set over in lieu of exempt property.

       In this section the phrase “in case decedent shall not have any or all of the property specified under said exemption laws” (now “If decedent does not have any or all of the property specified under the exemption laws”) was used. If the legislature had intended this phrase to mean in case decedent's estate shall not have any or all of the property specified, it should have used the words “decedent's estate” instead of the word “decedent.” However, by use of the word “decedent” the legislature made the phrase “in case decedent shall not have” applicable as of the time of death and not during the process of administration which follows death.

       § 2-7-505.
    Procedure for setting off exempt property.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Any time during the administration of an estate and after the first publication of notice of opening the probate and the filing of the appraisement, any person interested may file a petition showing the necessary facts and praying to have the exempt property of the estate including the homestead set over to the person or persons entitled thereto. Upon filing of the petition, the court shall require all persons interested to appear on a day certain to show cause why the exempt property should not be set over to the person or persons entitled thereto. The order shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the probate is pending and a copy of the order to show cause shall be mailed by the personal representative to each heir and beneficiary. The publication and mailing shall be not less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing. At the time set for the hearing or to which the hearing is continued, the court shall hear the evidence and make such order as the facts and law require. If the whole estate of the decedent is found to be exempt and is set over to the person or persons entitled thereto, no further proceeding is required in the administration of the estate unless further estate is discovered. The publication and notice may be combined with and included in the notice of opening the probate, but the hearing shall not be held less than ten (10) days after the filing of the appraisement.

       Though this section was originally enacted as part of an act which amended various sections of the Probate Code, it should be noted that, prior to the 1980 revision of title 2, it was ostensibly applicable not only to probate matters but to any case in which a homestead exemption was involved in that it started out by stating “Wheresoever in the statutes …”; however, the 1980 revision substituted the language “Wheresoever in the Probate Code …” at the beginning of the section.

      At any sale of real or personal property upon which there is a mortgage, pledge or other lien, the holder of the lien may become the purchaser, and may apply the amount of his lien on the purchase price. If no claim thereon has been filed or allowed, the court, at the hearing on the report of sale and for confirmation of the sale, may examine into the validity and enforceability of the lien or charge and the amount due thereunder and secured thereby, and may authorize the personal representative to accept the receipt of the purchaser for the amount due thereunder and secured thereby as payment pro tanto. If the mortgage, pledge or other lien is a valid claim against the estate and has been allowed, the receipt of the purchaser for the amount due him from the proceeds of the sale is a payment pro tanto. If the amount for which the property is purchased, whether or not a claim for it has been filed or allowed, is insufficient to defray the expenses and discharge his mortgage, pledge or other lien, the purchaser shall pay an amount sufficient to pay the balance of the expenses. Nothing permitted under this section shall be deemed to be an allowance of a claim based upon such mortgage, pledge or other lien.

       District court properly granted an estate's motion to dismiss a creditor's complaint as untimely because, while the certified mailing to the creditor was not constitutionally adequate notice, the estate strictly complied with the statutory notice requirements by filing the notice of rejection in district court and mailing the rejection notice to the creditor via certified mail, and the creditor failed to timely file its complaint after receiving constitutionally adequate notice of the estate's claim rejection.

     <p>
      If any person dies seized of a life estate which terminates by reason of his death, or of an estate by the entireties, or of an estate by joint tenancy or joint estate with another, any person interested in the property or in the title thereto may file in the district court of the county in which the property is situated a verified petition setting forth such facts. After two (2) weeks notice by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, or otherwise as the court may order, the court shall hear the petition and the evidence offered in support thereof. If upon hearing it appears to the court that such life estate, estate by entireties, estate by joint tenancy or joint estate was created and vested, and that the life estate of the deceased person terminated by reason of death, or that the estate by entireties remains vested solely in the surviving spouse by reason of death, or that the estate by joint tenancy or joint estate remains vested solely in the surviving joint tenant or joint tenants, the court shall so decree. A certified copy of the decree shall be recorded in the office of the county clerk and thereafter the decree and the record thereof together with the record of the instrument or instruments purporting to create the life estate, estate by entireties, estate by joint tenancy or joint estate, shall be presumptive evidence of the creation of such estate, the termination thereof and the survivorship of the estate by entireties, estates by joint tenancy or joint estate.

     Wyoming is one of the few states which have adopted the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act,
   
   as it relates to federal estate taxes. In re Estate of Ogburn, 406 P.2d 655, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo. LEXIS 164</cite> (Wyo. 1965), commented on in 1 Land &amp; Water L. Rev. 526 (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     Chapter is designed to clarify who is liable for payment of the estate taxes
   
   when there is no provision in the decedent's will specifying how such tax shall be borne. Stevenson v. Hall, 473 P.2d 581, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 188</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter accomplishes three general purposes. First, it preserves the inherent and recognized right of a testator or testatrix to designate the fund from which such taxes are to be paid. Secondly, it abrogates the common law rule that, absent such a designation, the burden of payment was first to be imposed upon the residuary estate. Thirdly, and again absent a directive in the will to the contrary, it apportions the tax — without regard to special or general devises and bequests — commensurately to those benefited by the gifts of property upon which the federal tax has been imposed. In re Estate of Ogburn, 406 P.2d 655, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo. LEXIS 164</cite> (Wyo. 1965), commented on in 1 Land &amp; Water L.

    </p>
    <p>
     If a will does not provide for apportionment of the federal estate tax, and does not clearly direct against apportionment, then the tax will be apportioned under the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act in effect in Taggart v. United States, 306 F. Supp. 430, 1969 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 12890 (D. Wyo. 1969), aff'd, 430 F.2d 1388, 1970 U.S. App. LEXIS 7416 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1970).

     Depending, of course, upon the complexity of the testamentary plan, a few simple words may suffice to effectuate that purpose. It is essential, however, that the words, or combination of words, used in the will sufficiently indicate an intention against apportionment. In case of doubt the burden of the taxes must be left where the law places it. In re Estate of Ogburn, 406 P.2d 655, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo.

     A somewhat ambiguous tax clause may contain language sufficient to disclose an intent on the part of the testator or testatrix to shift the burden of the federal estate tax levied upon decedent's property passing under the will and yet be insufficient to shift the tax levied upon the transfer of a decedent's interest in property which is not controlled by the will.

All legacy, succession, inheritance and like taxes (as distinguished from estate taxes), imposed by reason of my death on any property (whether disposed of by this will or not), and interest to penalties thereon, shall be borne by my residuary estate,” it seems clear that she wished the estate taxes to be borne by her residuary estate, and the trial court was correct in its disposition of tax apportionment under the express provisions of the will and not according to the Uniform Estate Tax Apportionment Act.

       A decree of distribution is final and res judicata regardless of an erroneous distribution. The effect of the decree being res judicata means the probate proceedings are ended; that property of the estate remains distributed as it has been distributed; and that the discharge of the executor and his bonding company is final, unless a case of fraud is asserted and proved.

      <p>
       Where a widow was not given the benefit of whatever exemption or deduction was allowed for her, in that respect the distribution made was erroneous. However, since there was no appeal from the decree of distribution and no timely action to vacate or set it aside, the decree became final and res judicata. But it does not necessarily follow that the widow is without remedy, if she can show causes of action accrued to her against some of the distributees of the estate when settlement of the federal estate tax was made.

If on the day set for hearing the petition no objection is made, the judge shall make an order admitting the certified copies of the proceedings in the estate to record in his court and they shall be considered and treated from that time as original proceedings in his court and shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein shown. If at such hearing any creditor objects to the proceedings and shows that the decedent is indebted to him, his claim not having been presented in the original state, the matter shall be postponed and the creditor or other person shall be allowed to petition for letters of administration as in other cases.

    Naming of executors and trustees; generally; appointment of agents for service; bond when executor sole legatee; applicability of provisions.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The testator may name in his will as executor or trustee any person or persons who are residents and citizens of the United States, or any bank or trust company organized under the laws of this state or of the United States and doing business in this state. When it appears to the court having jurisdiction that any individual named as an executor or trustee in any will is not a resident of this state or that any bank or trust company named as executor or trustee is not authorized to do business in this state, the court shall require the executor or trustee to designate a resident, bank or trust company of this state as agent or attorney upon whom any order, notice or process issued out of the courts of this state may be served. Service on the agent or attorney has the same effect as if served upon the nonresident executor or trustee in person. If any nonresident executor or trustee fails to appoint an agent or attorney, the court shall revoke his authority to act. When the person named as executor is also the sole legatee, instead of the bond required by other provisions herein of an executor, he may give a bond to the state in a sum and with sureties the court requires, conditioned only to pay within the time fixed by the court all the debts of the testator which are filed or exhibited within the time fixed by the notice to creditors. He shall return an inventory and appraisement as in other cases. Upon execution and approval of the bond, the filing of the inventory and appraisement and the publication of notice to creditors, the estate of the testator vests absolutely in the sole legatee and the debts of the testator so filed or exhibited become charges against the legatee. Upon breach of the condition of the bond, suit may be instituted on the bond by any creditor in the name of the state for the use of the creditor. The provisions hereof apply to all wills hereafter admitted to probate.

       Where nonresident is appointed as executor, and personally submits to jurisdiction of the court and personally conducts settlement of the estate, he cannot be removed from office on ground of his nonresidence unless he subsequently permanently “removes” from the state, in sense of permanently absenting himself from place where business of his trust is transacted, or withdrawing himself beyond process of the court.

      <p>
       The legislature intended in this section to give force to the rule of the common law that no man shall be permitted to profit by his own wrongful act. To adopt the interpretation that a person is barred from receiving insurance proceeds by conviction of killing under circumstances such as to render the killing a felony would be to prohibit those so convicted from taking although they had no intention or desire to actually kill or even harm the insured.

      <p>
       Where a person was indicted for the second degree murder of his wife but pleaded guilty to manslaughter, while it appeared that he unlawfully caused the death of his wife, there was nothing before the court to show the killing was intentional, which circumstance — under the supreme court's interpretation of the meaning of the word “feloniously” — is essential to any determination that his rights to insurance were forfeited.

      <p>
       Historically, in the absence of a statute, the various jurisdictions of this country have held a beneficiary who has intentionally and feloniously caused the death of the insured may not collect the insurance proceeds. It seems quite clear that this section was enacted as a codification of the common law. It is true that the word “intentionally” is not employed in this section. However, the background of interpretation in the field is convincing that such is the only reasonable meaning which can be given. Dowdell v. Bell, 477 P.2d 170, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo.

      <p>
       While a number of states, perhaps the majority, which have no express provision for insurance proceeds, hold that, when a primary beneficiary is barred, the proceeds should be paid to the contingent beneficiary, this section clearly prevents such disposition by its provision that “all benefits that would accrue to any such person upon the death of the person whose life is thus taken, shall become subject to distribution among the other heirs of such deceased person according to the rules of descent and distribution.” Dowdell v. Bell, 477 P.2d 170, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 205</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       Phrase “subject to distribution”
   
   is a phrase commonly used in connection with the administration of estates; if the intent of the legislature was to vest the cause of action directly in the heirs, the language used is an awkward and inapposite means of expressing a simple thought.

     Laws 1982, ch. 54, §§ 2 through 8, read:
    </p>
    <p>
     “Section 2. The Wyoming Legislature finds the title to the 1981 Senate File 88 which attempted to repeal the wrongful death statutes was inaccurate and misleading in that it said the wrongful death statutes duplicated statutes which were no longer in existence, which statement was not true; the action repealing those statutes was in reliance upon the accuracy of the statement that there were duplicate statutes found in other places in the statutes, and therefore, the Wyoming Legislature by this act hereby declares the attempted repeal of W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-201" target="_self">2-14-201</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-202" target="_self">2-14-202</a></cite> by Chapter 151, Session Laws of Wyoming 1981, void.

    </p>
    <p>
     “Section 4. At the time Chapter 151 was enacted in 1981, it was the belief of the Wyoming Legislature that W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c38s1-38-101" target="_blank">1-38-101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c38s1-38-102" target="_blank">1-38-102</a></cite> were in full force and effect, and that W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-201" target="_self">2-14-201</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-202" target="_self">2-14-202</a></cite> were duplicative and therefore superfluous statutes and those facts were recited in the title to Original Senate File 88, which became Chapter 151, Session Laws of Wyoming 1981.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Section 5. The legislature declares that its sole purpose in enacting Chapter 151, Session Laws of Wyoming 1981, was to delete statutes relating to wrongful death that were erroneously believed to be duplicative.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Section 6. The legislature further declares that its purpose in that repeal was not to eliminate or affect in any way causes of action for wrongful death.
    </p>

     “Section 7. Should a determination be reached that the inadvertent attempted repeal was legally effective, this retroactive application is intended to cure that inadvertent and unintentional repeal of W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-201" target="_self">2-14-201</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t02c14a02s2-14-202" target="_self">2-14-202</a></cite> and to retroactively reinstate such sections, renumbered as W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c38s1-38-101" target="_blank">1-38-101</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c38s1-38-102" target="_blank">1-38-102</a></cite>.

      Only individuals whose registration of a security shows sole ownership by one (1) individual or multiple ownership by two (2) or more individuals with right of survivorship, rather than as tenants in common, may obtain registration in beneficiary form. Multiple owners of a security registered in beneficiary form hold as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as tenants by the entireties or as owners of community property held in survivorship form, and not as tenants in common.

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity’s principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner’s address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

    Ownership on death of owner.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners. Until division of the security after the death of all owners, multiple beneficiaries surviving the death of all owners hold their interest as tenants in common. If no beneficiary survives the death of all owners, the security belongs to the estate of the deceased sole owner or the estate of the last to die of all multiple owners.

    Terms, conditions and forms for registration.

     <p>
      A registering entity offering to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive requests (1) for registrations in beneficiary form, and (2) for implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, including requests for cancellation of previously registered TOD beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary’s descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary’s death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for “lineal descendants per stirpes.” This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary’s descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who fails to so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary’s domicile at the owner’s death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one (1) or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity’s terms and conditions.

If a transfer on death deed is executed by fewer than all of the owners of real property owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the transfer on death deed is valid if the last surviving owner is one of the persons who executes the transfer on death deed. If the last surviving owner did not execute the transfer on death deed, the transfer lapses and the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is not affected by the execution of a transfer on death deed that is executed by fewer than all of the owners of the real property, and the rights of a surviving joint tenant with right of survivorship prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a transfer on death deed.
