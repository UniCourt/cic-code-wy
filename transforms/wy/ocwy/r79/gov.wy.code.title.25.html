      <p>
       Where a new prison policy imposed after the murder of a guard prohibited prisoners from keeping certain personal property in their cells, the inmate was notified that his property would be destroyed; the inmate submitted a claim form to the Wyoming Department of Corrections (DOC) asking that he be repaid for the property's value, and asserted claims that his rights to due process, freedom of religion, and equal protection had been violated. The inmate's grievances were addressed by the warden and the DOC in a timely and courteous manner as contemplated by this section; the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the inmate's right to due process was not violated by this section, because he had other avenues of relief under U.S. Const. amend. 1 and Wyo. Const. art 1, § 8.

       District court improperly denied a government hospital's motion for partial summary judgment in a medical malpractice action arising from the actions of a nurse employed by a contracted anesthesia services provider because the nurse was not a “public employee” for purposes of the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act, and the Act did not provide an express waiver of sovereign immunity for non-employees of a governmental hospital; the district court erred in reading a prior appellate decision as implicitly waiving sovereign immunity against governmental entities for acts of ostensible or apparent agents.

The county attorney of the county where the application is filed shall appear on behalf of the state at the hearing. Any gatekeeper designated by the department pursuant to W.S. 25-10-112(g) shall appear at the hearing and provide testimony concerning continued detention and, if applicable, the issues outlined in subsection (m) of this section. Notice of the preliminary hearing shall be given to the county attorney, any gatekeeper designated by the department, the detained person and his parent, guardian and attorney. The court may delay the hearing only at the request of the detained person or his parent, guardian or his attorney. The hearing for continued detention may be waived at the request of the detained person or the detained person’s parent, guardian or attorney. If a hearing for continued detention has been waived, the court may immediately conduct the directed outpatient commitment or involuntary hospitalization hearing.

    Discharge of patient held on order in action arising out of criminal offense.

     <p>
      A patient held on order of a court having criminal jurisdiction in any action or proceeding arising out of a criminal offense shall not be discharged except upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction. At any time the head of the hospital is of the opinion that the person is no longer affected by mental illness or deficiency, or that he no longer presents a substantial risk of danger to himself or others, the head of the hospital shall apply to the court which committed the person for an order of discharge. The court having criminal jurisdiction in the matter shall conduct a hearing not less than once each year to determine whether the continued hospitalization of the patient is necessary, based on the reports required under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c10a01s25-10-116" target="_self">25-10-116</a></cite> and any other information provided to the court by the state hospital or the federal hospital under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c10a01s25-10-111" target="_self">25-10-111</a></cite>, as appropriate, or the patient’s counsel. After a hearing, the court shall make its findings and enter an order as provided in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t25c10a01s25-10-118ol1c" target="_self">25-10-118(c)</a></cite>.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in terms of such welfare.
