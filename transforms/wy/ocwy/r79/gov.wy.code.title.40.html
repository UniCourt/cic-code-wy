       Unless a trade name is confusing and deceptive on its face, those seeking such protection must take the burden of proving that they have given to their trade names a secondary meaning through years of usage and if in this case defendant was to be allowed to use its new name, the public would be confused by its similarity to the trade names of plaintiffs.

As part of any investigation under this section, the attorney general may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, documents or other matters, propound interrogatories to be answered in writing under oath and collect evidence. Any interrogatory or subpoena served under this subsection shall inform the party served of the right to file a petition as provided by subsection (b) of this section.

       Not later than five (5) business days after the service of any interrogatory or subpoena or at any time before the return date specified in the interrogatory or subpoena, the party served under this section may file in the district court in the county in which the party resides, the district court in the county where the party transacts business or the district court in Laramie county a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the interrogatory or subpoena. Any petition filed under this subsection shall be served upon the attorney general. The petitioner may raise any objection or privilege that would be available under this act or upon service of a subpoena in a civil action.

       If any matter that the attorney general seeks to obtain by subpoena is not located within Wyoming and is not reducible to electronic reproduction and transmission, the party subpoenaed may make the matter available to the attorney general to examine the matter at the place where it is located. The attorney general may designate representatives, including officials of the state in which the matter is located, to inspect the matter on the attorney general’s behalf. The attorney general may respond to similar requests from officials of other states and may inspect a matter on their behalf.

       The attorney general may request that an individual who refuses to comply with a subpoena or answer an interrogatory on the grounds that the testimony or matter may incriminate the individual be ordered by the court to provide the testimony or matter. Except for a prosecution for perjury, an individual who complies with a court order to provide testimony or matter after asserting a privilege against self-incrimination to which the individual is entitled by law shall not have the testimony or matter provided, or evidence derived therefrom, or received against the individual used in any criminal investigation or proceeding.

The attorney general may, upon petition to the court, recover a civil penalty not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00).

       For purposes of this section, “home solicitation sale” means the sale or lease of merchandise, other than farm equipment, for cash when the cash sales price, whether under a single sale or multiple sales, exceeds twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and in which the seller or a person acting for him engages in a personal solicitation of the sale at the residence of the buyer and the buyer’s agreement or offer to purchase is there given to the seller or a person acting for him. A personal solicitation of a sale at the residence of the buyer includes contact with the buyer in person or by telephone. “Home solicitation sale” does not include:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t40c12a01s40-12-104ol1ai">

        </li>
        <li id="t40c12a01s40-12-104ol1aiii">
         A sale made pursuant to a telephone solicitation when the seller offers a full refund and right of cancellation for at least ten (10) days after receipt of the merchandise and the right of refund and cancellation is communicated during the initial telephone solicitation and is conspicuously displayed with the merchandise; or

       Except as hereinafter provided, in addition to any right otherwise to revoke an offer, the buyer has the right to cancel a home solicitation sale until midnight of the third business day after the day on which the buyer signs an agreement or offer to purchase which complies with this part. Cancellation occurs when the buyer gives written notice of cancellation to the seller at the address stated in the agreement or offer to purchase. Notice of cancellation, if given by mail, is given when it is deposited in a mailbox properly addressed and postage prepaid. Notice of cancellation given by the buyer need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it indicates by any form of written expression the intention of the buyer not to be bound by the home solicitation sale.

The action may be brought in the district court of the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business or in the district court of Laramie county, Wyoming. The district court may issue temporary restraining orders, including ex parte temporary restraining orders, or preliminary or permanent injunctions, in accordance with the principles of equity, to restrain and prevent violations of this act. The court may make such additional orders or judgments as are necessary to compensate identifiable persons for actual damages or restoration of money or property, real or personal, which may have been acquired by means or any act or practice restrained.

       If, by inquiry by the enforcing authority or as a result of complaints, the enforcing authority has probable cause to believe that a person has engaged in, or is engaging in, an act or practice that violates this act, investigators designated by the Wyoming attorney general may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses or matter, and collect evidence. Within five (5) days, excluding weekends and legal holidays, after the service of a subpoena or at any time before the return date specified therein, whichever is longer, the party served may file in the district court in the county in which the party resides or in which the party transacts business, or in the district court for the first judicial district of Wyoming, and serve upon the enforcing authority a petition for an order modifying or setting aside the subpoena. The petitioner may raise any objection or privilege which would be available under this act or upon service of a subpoena in a civil action. The subpoena shall inform the party served of the party’s rights under this subsection.

       The enforcing authority may request that an individual who refuses to comply with a subpoena on the ground that testimony or matter may incriminate the individual, be ordered by the court to provide the testimony or matter. Except in a prosecution for perjury, an individual who complies with a court order to provide testimony or matter after asserting a privilege against self-incrimination to which the individual is entitled by law shall not have the testimony or matter so provided, or evidence derived therefrom, received against the individual in any criminal investigation or proceeding.

    </p>
    <p>
     The division of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code into articles and parts has been retained in this compilation as enacted by Laws 1971, ch. 191. The act, however, did not include any articles 7 and 8. Article 9, therefore, appears as article 7 in this compilation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Laws 1996, ch. 86, § 5, effective July 1, 1996, provides: “The department of audit shall include within its annual report the fees established and assessed under the Uniform Consumer Credit Code and the department's total costs of regulation under the Code.”

       The payment by a developer of a prior bill, which included interest charges, was merely a settlement of a contract for initial platting services, which was separate and divisible from a contract entered some 18 months later for replatting services. The record contained no evidence to support a conclusion that the developer agreed to pay interest on the replatting contract, which was the debt for which the action was brought. Accordingly, the plaintiff surveyor could not be awarded interest above the statutory rate. Miles v. CEC Homes, 753 P.2d 1021, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 46</cite> (Wyo. 1988).

       Prejudgment interest was appropriate in a lien foreclosure action by a subcontractor because the claim was readily determinable from the labor and materials invoices attached to the lien statement. Absent a contractual agreement to a different percentage, the appropriate measure of prejudgment interest was the seven percent per annum stated in this section.

       Assignee was not entitled to prejudgment interest at seven percent, after maturity, because the parties' contractual agreement to six percent interest applied after maturity. Halling v. Yovanovich, 2017 WY 28, 391 P.3d 611, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 29</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

   so long as it does not take on the character of interest, which the term “credit service charge” implicates. The proper procedure is to utilize the late payment fee to insure prompt payment and pursue strict procedures to collect debts that are past due. Iberlin v. TCI Cablevision, 855 P.2d 716, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 113</cite> (Wyo. 1993).

        Delay in making payment not credit service charge. —

      </p>
      <p>
       If a delay in making payment is permitted until the completion of the services furnished, the creditor is affording a benefit to the debtor for which the debtor is delaying, even temporarily, full payment. That arrangement is not an extension of credit so long as payment is required upon completion of the services and no extension of credit occurs when the creditor requires payment in full before any services are furnished.

      <p>
       Without evidence that a business anticipates that a particular customer will not pay his bill when due and, therefore, assesses a credit service charge in the guise of a late payment charge, a late payment charge comes within the exception in the WUCCC for an actual unanticipated late payment.

     <p>
      “Cash price” means the price at which the creditor offers, in the ordinary course of business, to sell for cash the property or services which are the subject of a consumer credit transaction. It may include the cash price of accessories or services related to the sale such as delivery, installation, alterations, modifications, and improvements, and may include taxes to the extent imposed on the cash sale, but shall not include any other charges of the types described in section 1026.4 of regulation Z of the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act.

       All classes of credit transactions in the state of Wyoming have been declared exempt from the disclosure requirements of the federal Truth in Lending Act, by the federal reserve board under the authority granted it by that act. This exemption serves to replace the federal requirements with those set forth in this chapter, which are almost identical. Hinkle v. Rock Springs Nat'l Bank, 538 F.2d 295, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 8089 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1976).

      <p>
       The exemption of credit transactions in Wyoming from the disclosure requirements of the federal Truth in Lending Act by its own terms does not exempt state transactions from the civil liability provisions of the federal act, but rather makes exception for that remedy. This would seem to also protect the concurrent jurisdiction created in the federal act. Hinkle v. Rock Springs Nat'l Bank, 538 F.2d 295, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 8089 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1976).

      <p>
       Where the Wyoming disclosure provisions require the seller to disclose to the credit consumer “… the information required by either this part or the federal Consumer Credit Protection Act …,” the state and federal requirements are the same. Thus, the action remains one in which federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction, but there is but one cause of action and thus but one recovery for a nondisclosure. Hinkle v. Rock Springs Nat'l Bank, 538 F.2d 295, 1976 U.S. App. LEXIS 8089 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1976).

      </p>
      <p>
       This section prohibits only a seller or lessor from taking a negotiable instrument as evidence of the obligation created. No mention is made of any other party, and a bank is neither a seller nor a lessor. Rather a bank is a “lender” governed by the provisions of article 3 of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and nowhere within that article is there a similar prohibition. Consequently, a bank can accept negotiable paper. Stevens v. Rock Springs Nat'l Bank, 577 P.2d 1374, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 286</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

       The first 2021 amendment, by ch. 14, § 2, effective July 1, 2021, rewrote the section heading, which read, "Loan finance charge for consumer loans other than supervised loans"; rewrote (a), which read, "With respect to a consumer loan other than a supervised loan (W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c14a03s40-14-341" target="_self">40-14-341</a></cite>), a lender may contract for and receive a loan finance charge, calculated according to the actuarial method, not exceeding ten percent (10%) per year on the unpaid balances of the principal"; added the second sentence in (b); substituted "(g)" for "(a)" following subsection" in (e) and (e)(i); in (f), deleted "Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, and" at the beginning and made stylistic changes; and added (g) and (h).

       The second 2021 amendment, by ch. 14, § 3, effective July 1, 2021, repealed (d), which read, "With respect to a consumer loan made pursuant to a revolving loan account:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i) The loan finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed ten percent (10%) per year if the loan finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a charge in each monthly billing cycle which is five-sixths of one percent of an amount no greater than:

       “(ii) If the billing cycle is not monthly, the loan finance charge shall be deemed not to exceed ten percent (10%) per year if the loan finance charge contracted for and received does not exceed a percentage which bears the same relation to five-sixths of one percent as the number of days in the billing cycle bears to thirty (30); and

       “(iii) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, if there is an unpaid balance on the date as of which the loan finance charge is applied, the lender may contract for and receive a charge not exceeding fifty cents ($.50) if the billing cycle is monthly or longer, or the pro rata part of fifty cents ($.50) which bears the same relation to fifty cents ($.50) as the number of days in the billing cycle bears to thirty (30) if the billing cycle is shorter than monthly, but no charge may be made pursuant to this paragraph if the lender has made an annual charge for the same period as permitted by the provisions on additional charges (W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c14a03s40-14-311ol1aiii" target="_self">40-14-311(a)(iii)</a></cite>)."

     <p>
      No lender shall permit any person or two (2) married persons to become obligated in any way under more than one (1) loan agreement with the lender or with a person related to the lender with intent to obtain a higher rate of loan finance charge than would otherwise be permitted or to avoid disclosure of an annual percentage rate pursuant to the laws relating to disclosure and advertising. The excess amount of loan finance charge provided for in agreements in violation of this section is an excess charge for the purposes of the provisions on the effect of violations on rights of parties (W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c14a05s40-14-521" target="_self">40-14-521</a></cite>) and the provisions on civil actions by administrator (W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c14a06s40-14-613" target="_self">40-14-613</a></cite>).

Each plan installment shall be due on or after a date on which the consumer receives regular income, or if the consumer has no regular income due dates shall be a minimum of two (2) weeks between installments. The consumer may prepay an extended payment plan in full at any time without penalty. As long as the consumer complies with the terms of the extended payment plan, the plan shall be at no additional cost to the consumer and the post-dated check casher shall not charge the consumer any interest or additional fees during the term of the extended payment plan. The post-dated check casher may, with each payment under the plan by a consumer, provide for the return of the consumer’s prior held check and require a new check for the remaining balance under the plan.

Upon default, notwithstanding W.S. 40-14-363(a), the post-dated check casher may charge the consumer interest on the outstanding balance at an annual rate equal to six percent (6%) plus the prime rate as listed in the Wall Street Journal on January 1 of the year in which the consumer defaults.

       If a creditor has violated the provisions of this act applying to certain negotiable instruments (W.S. 40-14-237), the debtor is not obligated to pay the credit service charge or loan finance charge, and has a right to recover from the person violating this act or from an assignee of that person’s rights who undertakes direct collection of payments or enforcement of rights arising from the debt a penalty in an amount determined by the court not in excess of three (3) times the amount of the credit service charge or loan finance charge. No action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement with respect to which the violation occurred.

       If a creditor has violated the provisions of this act applying to licensure to make consumer loans (W.S. 40-14-302), the loan is void and the debtor is not obligated to pay either the principal or loan finance charge. If he has paid any part of the principal or of the loan finance charge, he has a right to recover the payment from the person violating this act or from an assignee of that person’s rights who undertakes direct collection of payments or enforcement of rights arising from the debt. With respect to violations arising from other loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was paid.

       A debtor is not obligated to pay a charge in excess of that allowed by this act, and if he has paid an excess charge he has a right to a refund. A refund may be made by reducing the debtor’s obligation by the amount of the excess charge. If the debtor has paid an amount in excess of the lawful obligation under the agreement, the debtor may recover the excess amount from the person who made the excess charge or from an assignee of that person’s rights who undertakes direct collection of payments from or enforcement of rights against debtors arising from the debt.

       If a debtor is entitled to a refund and a person liable to the debtor refuses to make a refund within a reasonable time after demand, the debtor may recover from that person a penalty in an amount determined by a court not exceeding the greater of either the amount of the credit service or loan finance charge or ten (10) times the amount of the excess charge. If the creditor has made an excess charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this act, the penalty may be recovered even though the creditor has refunded the excess charge. No penalty pursuant to this subsection may be recovered if a court has ordered a similar penalty assessed against the same person in a civil action by the administrator (W.S. 40-14-613). With respect to excess charges arising from sales made pursuant to revolving charge accounts or from loans made pursuant to revolving loan accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two (2) years after the time the excess charge was made. With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit sales or consumer loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made.

Damages recoverable shall not exceed lost wages for six (6) weeks.

An action may relate to transactions with more than one (1) debtor. If it is found that an excess charge has been made, the court shall order the respondent to refund to the debtor or debtors the amount of the excess charge. If a creditor has made an excess charge in deliberate violation of or in reckless disregard for this act, or if a creditor has refused to refund an excess charge within a reasonable time after demand by the debtor or the administrator, the court may also order the respondent to pay to the debtor or debtors a civil penalty in an amount determined by the court not in excess of the greater of either the amount of the credit service or loan finance charge or ten (10) times the amount of the excess charge. Refunds and penalties to which the debtor is entitled pursuant to this subsection may be set off against the debtor’s obligation. If a debtor brings an action against a creditor to recover an excess charge or civil penalty, an action by the administrator to recover for the same excess charge or civil penalty shall be stayed while the debtor’s action is pending and shall be dismissed if the debtor’s action is dismissed with prejudice or results in a final judgment granting or denying the debtor’s claim. With respect to excess charges arising from sales made pursuant to revolving charge accounts or from loans made pursuant to revolving loan accounts, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than two (2) years after the time the excess charge was made. With respect to excess charges arising from other consumer credit sales or consumer loans, no action pursuant to this subsection may be brought more than one (1) year after the due date of the last scheduled payment of the agreement pursuant to which the charge was made. If the creditor establishes by a preponderance of evidence that a violation is unintentional or the result of a bona fide error, no liability to pay a penalty shall be imposed under this subsection.

       The administrator may bring a civil action against a creditor or a person acting in his behalf to recover a civil penalty for willfully violating this act, and if the court finds that the defendant has engaged in a course of repeated and willful violations of this act, it may assess a civil penalty of no more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). No civil penalty pursuant to this subsection may be imposed for violations of this act occurring more than two (2) years before the action is brought or for making unconscionable agreements or engaging in a course of fraudulent or unconscionable conduct.

       The administrator may issue to a person licensed under this act an order to show cause why his license should not be revoked or suspended for a period not in excess of six (6) months. The order shall state the place for a hearing and set a time for the hearing that is no less than ten (10) days from the date of the order. After the hearing the administrator shall revoke or suspend the license if he finds that:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t40c14a06p03s40-14-635ol1ai">

      </li>
      <li id="t40c14a06p03s40-14-635ol1b">
       No revocation or suspension of a license is lawful unless prior to institution of proceedings by the administrator notice is given to the licensee of the facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee is given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for retention of the license.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c14a06p03s40-14-635ol1c">
       If the administrator finds that probable cause for revocation of a license exists and that enforcement of this act requires immediate suspension of a license pending investigation, he may, after a hearing upon five (5) days written notice, enter an order suspending the license for not more than thirty (30) days.
      </li>
      <li id="t40c14a06p03s40-14-635ol1d">
       Whenever the administrator revokes or suspends a license, he shall enter an order to that effect and forthwith notify the licensee of the revocation or suspension. Within five (5) days after the entry of the order he shall deliver to the licensee a copy of the order and the findings supporting the order.

       Any person holding a license under this act may relinquish the license by notifying the administrator in writing of its relinquishment, but this relinquishment shall not affect his liability for acts previously committed.

     The paramount purpose of this chapter is to eliminate the trading stamp company business which was causing trouble and which, excluding the business of merchants who issued their own stamps and redeemed the same in cash or from their own merchandise, at least in the legislative view, presented an evil to be dealt with.

       To hold subsection (a)(ii) unconstitutional would leave the balance of this chapter going beyond the legislature's purpose and contrary to its expressed intent. Steffey v. Casper, 358 P.2d 951, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 75</cite> (Wyo. 1961).

      </p>
      <p>
       It is evident from their enactment of subsection (a)(ii) that the legislature felt there was a clear distinction between those participants in the trading stamp business so excepted and those made subject to § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c16s40-16-101" target="_self">40-16-101</a></cite>.Steffey v.

      <p>
       Exception of subsection (a)(ii) from operation of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c16s40-16-101" target="_self">40-16-101</a></cite> is reasonable and proper classification. —
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a merchant issues and redeems his own stamps, it amounts to nothing more than giving a discount on purchases from him, and this in itself makes a distinction between trading stamps being sold to the merchant by a trading stamp company and a merchant issuing and redeeming his own stamps from his own stock or in cash. Therefore the legislature made a reasonable and proper classification when it excepted subsection (a)(ii) from the operation of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40c16s40-16-101" target="_self">40-16-101</a></cite>.Steffey v.

The commissioner may increase the required amount of the security device up to the maximum amount authorized by this subsection upon the basis of the impaired financial condition of a licensee as evidenced by a reduction in net worth, financial losses or other relevant criteria. The security device shall be in a form satisfactory to the commissioner and shall run to the state for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments or transmission of money.

       The first 2016 amendment, by ch. 115 § 1, in the introductory language of (a), inserted “from private land” following “data”; in (a)(i) substituted “private” for “open” preceding “land”; in (a)(i)(A), substituted “enter the private land” for “enter or access the land” and inserted “the specified” preceding “resource data”; in (a)(ii)(B), deleted “open” following “private” and inserted “from private land” following “data”; in the introductory language of (b), deleted “open” preceding “land” and inserted “from private land” preceding “without”; in (b)(ii), inserted “private” preceding “land”; added present (c); redesignated former (c) as (d) and inserted “or a person who trespasses to access adjacent or proximate land” in the first sentence; redesignated former (d) as (f) and inserted “on private land” following “collected”; redesignated former (f) as (g) and inserted “on private land” following “collected”; and added (h).

       The second 2016 amendment, by ch. 115 § 2, repealed former (e), which read: “Resource data unlawfully collected under this section is not admissible in evidence in any civil, criminal or administrative proceeding, other than a civil action for trespassing under this section or a criminal prosecution for trespass.”

       Plaintiffs could not have maintained a Free Speech First Amendment challenge because the statutes did not regulate protected First Amendment activity, there was no constitutionally protected First Amendment right to enter upon the private lands of another for the purposes of collecting data, the statutes were not facially overbroad, and the court declined to conduct a facial analysis of the statutes' expungement provisions.

       Statutes passed
   the rational basis test and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection
   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutes were not promulgated
   out of animus toward a particular group, and did not burden a fundamental
   right because the statutes precluded trespassing to collect any resource
   data, regardless of whether that data was favorable or unfavorable
   to the owner, and the statutes rationally related to the interest
   of protecting private property rights. Western Watersheds Project v. Michael, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1231, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88843 (D. Wyo. 2016).
