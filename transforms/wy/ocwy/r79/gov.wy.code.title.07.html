      Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the officers' knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed.

      Criminal probable cause is the cause which logically leads to a conclusion that the person to be arrested is the one who had committed or was engaged in the commission of the crime. Rodarte v. Riverton, 552 P.2d 1245,

      An arresting officer may use information he gathers to bolster a tip by an informant to the point that there exists probable cause for arrest, if the information gathered by the officer is corroborative of the informant's tip; therefore, where the police made an arrest based upon the information that had come to them from an anonymous informant, and there was further corroboration of that information by the law enforcement officer both prior to and after the investigatory stop and the other information gained at that time, the police officers had the requisite probable cause for a warrantless arrest in accordance with this section.

      Phrases “the inquisition,” the “written evidence,” and “a list of witnesses” are construed in reference to each other, and while the word inquisition could refer to the official inquiry conducted by the jury, there is no doubt given “its company” that it refers to the record of the findings of the jury; the meaning of the word “inquisition” is evident, and the statute directs that a record of the proceedings be filed with the district court.

      Board of Coroner Standards did not have the authority to review complaints alleging that a coroner committed misconduct while conducting an inquest, and therefore the Board’s refusal to investigate the coroner’s alleged misconduct was affirmed, because this section authorized Board investigation for failure to comply with that subsection and made no reference to authority to investigate for alleged failure to comply with Board standards. The remainder of this section bolstered the court’s conclusion that the Board only had authority to review complaints related to coroner education and training. Hayse v. Wyo.

      Under Wyoming's judicial revocation procedure where the state is represented by a prosecutor and the rules of evidence apply to a portion of the proceedings, the Sixth Amendment requires appointment of counsel for indigent probationers when the indigent probationer is entitled to be represented by an attorney under subsection (a). An inescapable corollary to such a holding is the invalidation of W.R.Cr.P. 44(a)(2), in the context of judicial revocations. Pearl v. State, 996 P.2d 688,

      Trial court erred in ruling that the public defender had to accept all appointments to serve as counsel for indigent defendants unless and until the appointing court ruled otherwise, and therefore its order holding the state public defender in contempt for declining two appointments based on the unavailability of counsel was reversed, because this section afforded the public defender discretion to decline an appointment or appointments. The court further held that in exercising that discretion, there was no requirement, statutory or otherwise, that the public defender show an individualized injury in fact or meet the Strickland post-conviction showing of prejudice.

      District court had the authority on remand to amend defendant's sentence because the amended sentence was consistent with the district court's original sentence and merely reconfirmed that the statutorily-mandated fees remained part of defendant sentence; the statutory assessments were imposed because defendant had been convicted of a crime, and on remand, he still was convicted of a crime.

      Statutes indicate that the fees are imposed as a result of being convicted in a criminal case, not as part of the sentence for any particular crime; the statutes envision that sentencing courts impose the mandated fees separately as part of the overall sentence, rather than as part of the sentence for an individual charge.

      District court properly denied defendant's motions to correct an illegal sentence because there was no increase in punishment and no violation of his double jeopardy protections; all of the fees imposed upon defendant's conviction were mandated by statute, and thus, it was unnecessary for the district court to attach the fees to the stalking charge in the initial sentence.

      Defendant was properly ordered to pay restitution to an insured victim because (1) there was no evidence in the record of a subrogation right, or lack thereof, so the insurer was not a victim entitled to restitution, (2) it was absurd not to order the defendant to pay anyone for damage defendant caused, and (3) equitable subrogation did not assist defendant, since, if a right of subrogation existed, the court had to award restitution to the owner of property defendant damaged, and (4) whether the victim would receive a double recovery was of no consequence, since restitution was a criminal penalty meant to have deterrent and rehabilitative effects.

      Order that the defendant pay as restitution, following his conviction for felony larceny, the entire cost of a surveillance system installed by his employer to investigate the ongoing thefts defendant was later convicted of, was error since the store owner admitted the surveillance equipment would be used after defendant's apprehension, and its continued benefit was a reason why he purchased the equipment.

      After defendant pled guilty to wrongfully taking or disposing of property, a district court erred by failing to set restitution based on the readily ascertainable fair market value of a stolen pickup truck since there was no support for the contention that the truck had a special, unique, or sentimental value; moreover, defendant did not waive the right to challenge the sentence imposed by signing the plea agreement.

      After defendant was convicted of felony property destruction, he claimed that the district court erred in ordering him to pay restitution in the amount of $1,400, the estimated value of the vehicle before the damage; it was not clear whether the district court ordered defendant to pay that amount because defense counsel did not object to the presentence investigation or because it concluded that the fair market value was the appropriate measure of restitution. Defense counsel did not waive the issue by his failure to object to the PSI because he sufficiently placed it before the sentencing court in challenging the appropriateness of the amount at the sentencing hearing and should the issue arise in any proceedings upon remand, the district court was required to take into account the prevailing law under Wyo.

      In a welfare
      fraud case, restitution was properly ordered in the amount of $ 90,722.79

      the
      ability to pay. Defendant was thirty-one years old, had a general

      Defendant was properly ordered to pay restitution to an insured victim because (1) there was no evidence in the record of a subrogation right, or lack thereof, so the insurer was not a victim entitled to restitution, (2) it was absurd not to order the defendant to pay anyone for damage defendant caused, and (3) equitable subrogation did not assist defendant, since, if a right of subrogation existed, the court had to award restitution to the owner of property defendant damaged, and (4) whether the victim would receive a double recovery was of no consequence, since restitution was a criminal penalty meant to have deterrent and rehabilitative effects.

      Restitution
      order was not supported by sufficient evidence because, even though
      restitution was generally measured by the damages to the victim,
      the
      State could not ignore the terms of the plea agreement, which
      limited
      the amount of defendant's restitution to amounts that he
      actually
      received. The State did not meet its burden of proving that
      defendant
      received or otherwise benefitted from a welfare fraud scheme
      in the
      amount of $ 2,600.15. O'Halloran v. State, 2014 WY 95, 331 P.3d 121,

      Statutory requirement for a restitution plan may contemplate that restitution-related conditions be included in a restitution plan, but it contains no language restricting a sentencing court’s authority to impose such conditions outside a formalized restitution plan, and the requirement of a restitution plan does not act to constrain the court’s discretion over restitution terms.

      It would be nonsensical to allow the sentencing court full discretion to set restitution terms as part of a restitution plan, but declare that exercise of discretion invalid if the court orders the same terms as separate probation conditions, and there is nothing that requires such a result; a district court has authority to impose restitution-related probation conditions in a restitution plan or separately, and the district court did not abuse its discretion or exceed its authority in imposing such conditions in this case.

      In an attempted first-degree murder case, defendant's equal protection rights under Batson were not violated by the prosecutor's exercise of two peremptory challenges against Hispanic jurors, where one of the Hispanic jurors knew one of the law enforcement witnesses, knew another witness's mother, and preferred not to miss an upcoming doctor's appointment, and the other Hispanic juror knew a witness.

      District court did not err in denying the motion asserting defendant’s trial attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to raise a challenge under Batson as the prosecutor testified that he struck Juror #116 because he did not have a spouse or children, did not have a job that interacts with people, and had recently changed jobs, and he or a family member had been a complainant, defendant, or witness in a criminal case; and the State’s reasons for utilizing a peremptory challenge on Juror # 116 were neutral and non-discriminatory.

The refusal to excuse such an unqualified juror for cause is prejudicial where the defendant challenges the juror for cause, the court denies the challenge, the defendant does not accept the jury because of it, and he exhausts his peremptory challenges.

      While it is true that new facts brought out on rebuttal may properly be met by surrebuttal evidence, that rule does not permit surrebuttal merely to supply evidence which could have been given in chief or to cumulate additional evidence or to fortify evidence already given, or to supplement such evidence because it has been impeached upon rebuttal.

     <p>
      In the federal system the court may give such charge to the jury as it sees fit, together with such comment, explanation, modification or change as it may desire. Under such a procedure, it is understandable why objection must be made following the giving of the charge. But under the state procedure the parties know beforehand exactly what instructions will be given, and in what language, as well as which of the requested instructions will be refused. Being so apprised, the parties are in a position to make objections to the court's rulings before the instructions are given the jury, setting forth with particularity their reasons, and the rulings of the court then made become final with no exceptions being necessary.

      The progress of a case through the judicial system from filing the information to trial was 181 days and more than half of this 181 days was attributable to the defendant, who did not vigorously assert his right to a speedy trial and, although he had the benefit of counsel, never pressed for an earlier setting. In fact, the defendant did not show in writing how a delay might prejudice his defense. Thus, he showed no prejudice caused by the delay. Roderick v. State, 858 P.2d 538,

Ann. § 7-11-303(a), after a psychiatrist's testimony outside the presence of the jury indicated that the defendant was at the very least unable to testify on the defendant's own behalf due to mental problems, thereby raising the question whether the defendant was competent to stand trial, as required by Wyo.

       A person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of the criminal conduct, as a result of mental illness or deficiency, he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. As used in this section, the terms mental illness or deficiency mean only those severely abnormal mental conditions that grossly and demonstrably impair a person’s perception or understanding of reality and that are not attributable primarily to self-induced intoxication as defined by W.S. 6-1-202(b).

       Evidence that a person is not responsible for criminal conduct by reason of mental illness or deficiency is not admissible at the trial of the defendant unless a plea of “not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency” is made. A plea of “not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency” may be pleaded orally or in writing by the defendant or his counsel at the time of his arraignment. The court, for good cause shown, may also allow that plea to be entered at a later time. Such a plea does not deprive the defendant of other defenses.

       In all cases where a plea of “not guilty by reason of mental illness or deficiency” is made, the court shall order an examination of the defendant by a designated examiner. The order may include, but is not limited to, an examination of the defendant at the Wyoming state hospital on an inpatient or outpatient basis, at a local mental health center on an inpatient or outpatient basis, or at his place of detention. In selecting the examination site, the court may consider proximity to the court, availability of an examiner and the necessity for security precautions. If the order provides for commitment of the defendant to a designated facility, the commitment shall continue no longer than a forty-five (45) day period for the observation and evaluation of the mental condition of the defendant, which time may be extended by the approval of the court.

      Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated because, calculating the days from October 21, 2004, the date defendant first raised the issue of his mental illness, to June 7, 2005, the date the district court finally resolved the issue once and for all, 230 days elapsed. Of the total 337 days of delay, those 230 were excludable under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 48, thus resulting in a remainder of 107 days; that 107 being well under the 180-day limit of Rule 48.

      Where state's doctor testified that defendant was sane but that he could not remember the exact date on which he examined the defendant but that he thought it was two days before defendant's discharge on April 12, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence that the doctor was elsewhere on April 10, such evidence having no other effect than discrediting the testimony of the witness.

      It was not error for the court to instruct the jury that “every defendant is presumed to be mentally responsible.” The jury could not have thought that such a presumption was conclusive, as other portions of the instruction discussed circumstances when a person is not legally responsible for his conduct, and that the defendant must prove by a greater weight of the evidence his lack of mental responsibility.

     <p>
      If a defendant sentenced to pay a fine or costs defaults in payment, the court may order the defendant to show cause why he should not be committed to jail. If the court finds that the defendant’s default is willful or is due to a failure on defendant’s part to make a good faith effort to obtain the funds required for the payment and the court determines that the defendant has an ability to pay or that a reasonable probability exists that the defendant will have an ability to pay, the court may order him committed until the fine or costs, or a specified part thereof, is paid. The defendant shall be given a credit for each day of imprisonment at the rate provided by W.S.

The petition shall be verified by the petitioner and shall state facts showing that at the time of conviction and at the time of filing the petition that person was without financial means to pay for the transcript. If the judge who imposed sentence, or any other judge of the court, finds that the defendant is without financial means with which to obtain the transcript of the proceedings at trial, the judge shall order the reporter to transcribe an original and copy of the reporter’s notes. The original of the transcript shall be filed with the clerk and the copy shall be delivered to the defendant without charge.

      In a no contest
      plea, defendant waived his right to appeal his claim that the district
      court did not properly advise him that his future employment opportunities
      could be affected by loss of the privilege to possess firearms because
      his plea waiver did not include any objection to the sufficiency
      of
      the firearms advisements; defendant repeatedly stated that he
      had
      read and understood the terms of the plea agreement, which included
      the firearm consequences of his plea; and there were no assertions
      that the district court relied on race or any other improper factor,
      that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel in the
      negotiation
      of the plea agreement, or that his sentence exceeded
      the statutory
      maximum. Henry v. State, 2015 WY 156, 362 P.3d 785,

      In a no contest
      plea, district court's firearms advisement was sufficient because,
      although the district court did not advise defendant word for word
      from the statute and the advisement was a bit confusing because it
      referred to the employment consequences of his convictions before
      telling him of the possibility of losing the firearm privilege, prior
      to the change of plea hearing, defendant had been advised of the
      firearms
      consequences of his convictions in the plea agreement, which
      he stated
      he had read and understood; and common sense would have
      told him that
      the employment consequences referred to by the district
      court at the
      change of plea hearing could be associated with his
      loss of firearms
      privileges. Henry v. State, 2015 WY 156, 362 P.3d 785,

      Appellate court could not review defendant's claim that the judgment and sentence entered after he pleaded guilty were illegal under this section due to the fact that he was not advised that his guilty pleas could result in the disqualification of his right to possess firearms pursuant to federal law because he raised it for the first time on appeal; moreover, even if the claim had been raised before the district court, it would have been barred by res judicata because the claim could have been raised on direct appeal and in defendant's petition for post-conviction relief.

      Nothing in this act shall be interpreted to prohibit a convicted person and the state from consenting to and conducting post-conviction DNA testing without filing a motion under W.S. 7-12-303(c). Notwithstanding any other provision of law governing post-conviction relief, if DNA test results are obtained under testing conducted upon consent of the parties and the results are favorable to the convicted person, the convicted person may file, and the court shall adjudicate, a motion for a new trial based on the DNA test results.

      Appellate jurisdiction was lacking over petitioner’s appeal of an order dismissing his Factual Innocence Act petition where the district court had performed an initial review under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-12-404(b) and determined the petition was statutorily noncompliant before dismissing it without prejudice, and such a dismissal was not a final appealable order under Wyo. R. App. P. 1.05.

      In a classical split sentence, the district court imposes an established sentence that includes incarceration in the county jail for a period of not more than one year with probation to follow the confinement for the balance of the established sentence. Kidd v. State, 937 P.2d 1334,

      When defendant pled guilty to one felony count of interference with a peace officer, he was sentenced to prison for a period of not less than three years nor more than six years; defendant's sentence was suspended pursuant to the split sentencing provision of this section, and he was ordered to serve 180 days in the county jail followed by four years of probation. After defendant admitted five violations of his probationary conditions, probation was revoked and the district court did not abuse its discretion in reimposing sentence.

      District court's rationale for rejecting the plea agreement (a split sentencing agreement which would have allowed for incarceration in the county jail and then supervised probation) was very similar to its later rationale for incarcerating defendant. In both instances, the district court stated that, under the totality of the circumstances (high blood alcohol content, driving on the wrong side of the road, other near accidents, and a prior drunk driving offense), probation would have sent the wrong message to the public.

      Courts properly denied defendants'

      One cannot benefit from his refusal to appear before the district court after being ordered so to do, and where defendant was aware of the proceedings instituted to revoke his probation, yet he chose to rely upon his claim of dialogue with officers of the sheriff's department in Texas, rather than consulting with the Wyoming court, the probation was tolled from the time the Petition for Order to Show Cause Why Probation Should Not Be Revoked was filed.

      Lower court had the authority to revoke defendant’s probation because the probation violation occurred during the probationary period in that, following defendant’s no contest plea, the court suspended the execution of defendant’s sentence in one case and placed defendant on supervised probation. Then, after defendant violated the conditions of the probationary sentence imposed in another case, the court commenced probation revocation proceedings against defendant during the period in which the execution of that sentence was suspended.

(1976) should be given proper consideration where probation is considered as an alternative to incarceration. Sanchez v. State, 592 P.2d 1130,

      Upon resentencing appellant for accessory to second degree murder, the district court was directed to consider his eligibility for probation because he was subject to a minimum twenty-year sentence — a sentence less than a term of life imprisonment for purposes of this section.

       Court must choose between probation and statutory range of sentence. —

     </p>
     <p>
      A court may not assess punishment below a mandated minimum term. However, this section permits a trial court to suspend a sentence entirely and place a defendant on probation for all crimes other than those punishable by life imprisonment or death. In other words, the court cannot impose a hybrid sentence of probation and incarceration which results in a prison term below the statutory minimum, but instead must choose between probation and the statutory range of sentence provided in the applicable statute.

      the court may not utilize this section in the same way that it might on sentencing for a single count. If the trial court wants to adopt a sentencing mix of imprisonment and probation, it must select a term of imprisonment and then suspend the execution of that sentence, placing the defendant on probation following any term of imprisonment.

      Where sentence is imposed on several counts, the court may not use the sentencing option outlined in this section in the same way it might on a single count.

      Although a public defender was appointed to represent the defendant at trial because of his allegedly impecunious circumstance, the defendant was premature in his contention that the monetary penalties imposed by the court as part of his sentence were tantamount to imprisonment for failure to pay a fine. Out of an abundance of caution, trial courts usually appoint the public defender to represent an accused if he requests such representation, even if his plea of indigency is suspect. If the defendant did not pay the fine, he would have had the opportunity to show the trial court that he made a good faith effort but was unable to discharge this obligation. Hamburg v.

      Lower court had the authority to revoke defendant’s probation because the probation violation occurred during the probationary period in that, following defendant’s no contest plea, the court suspended the execution of defendant’s sentence in one case and placed defendant on supervised probation. Then, after defendant violated the conditions of the probationary sentence imposed in another case, the court commenced probation revocation proceedings against defendant during the period in which the execution of that sentence was suspended.

However, defendant was placed on probation for a period of eight years, but five months after the original sentencing hearing had been held, the district court revoked defendant's probation and reinstated his original sentence. Because neither appellant's period of probation nor his term of incarceration exceeded the maximum term of imprisonment, his sentence was legal. Leyba v. State, 882 P.2d 863,

       Trial court erred in granting presentence confinement credit against life sentence
      </b>
      when it had imposed a life sentence for murder and two five-to-ten-year sentences, each to be served concurrently, for drug conspiracy and aggravated assault and battery convictions, but consecutive to the life sentence. The defendant was entitled to credit upon that sentence which would be a benefit to him if he should ever reach a circumstance where the credit could be utilized for his release from confinement; that is, the credit should have been applied to the five-to-ten-year sentences and not against time which he could have served under the life sentence or any commuted term to which it could have been reduced.

      The Wyoming Board of Parole's right to adopt its own procedures simply means that, barring any constitutional limitations, a parolee cannot seek judicial review of the board's decision upon grounds relating to the conduct of the board's hearings; however, the fact that the conduct of the hearing is not subject to review does not mean that the decision itself is not subject to review.

      The defendant argued that subsection (c)(ii) of this section violated the separation of powers requirement in his case because that statute might have permitted the parole board to perform both legislative and judicial functions by allowing the board to extend the period of his possible parole in the event he failed to make restitution, because the board had not yet exercised its statutory authority; however, the issue raised was not ripe for review. The defendant could seek review when he could demonstrate that the board had made some adverse decision. Brenning v. State, 870 P.2d 349,

       <li id="t07c13a04s7-13-423-aI.11ol1a">
        The compacting states to this interstate compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community; to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states; and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states. In addition, this compact will: create an interstate commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact; ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines; establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases, subject to state laws, by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators; monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance; and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.
       </li>
       <li id="t07c13a04s7-13-423-aI.11ol1b">
        The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of state laws, this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

      Execution of appellant's sentence was, in essence, conditionally stayed pending appellant's admission to the alcohol treatment center, and he was granted a furlough for that purpose under this section of the statute; however, because appellant willfully refused to conform his behavior to the expectations of the treatment program, he was transferred to the Wyoming Department of Corrections - a condition that was made clear to him at the time of his sentence. While the supreme court did not approve of the departure from the many sentencing alternatives that were available to the district court, appellant's sentence was not illegal under this section of the rule.

       Trial court erred in granting presentence confinement credit against life sentence
      </b>
      when it had imposed a life sentence for murder and two five-to-ten-year sentences, each to be served concurrently, for drug conspiracy and aggravated assault and battery convictions, but consecutive to the life sentence. The defendant was entitled to credit upon that sentence which would be a benefit to him if he should ever reach a circumstance where the credit could be utilized for his release from confinement; that is, the credit should have been applied to the five-to-ten-year sentences and not against time which he could have served under the life sentence or any commuted term to which it could have been reduced.

       Physical impairment disqualified from program participation. —

     <p>
      Although defendant had entered a plea agreement which recommended him for the Wyoming Youthful Offender Program, his inability to participate in the program due to a physical impairment did not violate the doctrines of equal protection and separation of powers and did not entitle the district court to correct his sentence. The defendant's plea was not induced by false promises and the error alleged did not fall within the narrow definition of illegal sentences; therefore, the warden's refusal to accept him in the program because of his physical injury was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest and was supportable.

       Effect on probation revocation. —

     </p>
     <p>
      When an intensive supervision program participant violates the program rules and regulations, the State is required to choose between subjecting that participant to administrative sanctions under the statute or revoking the participant's probation; if the State decides that a probationer who has violated a program rule should be subjected to administrative sanctions, then it must not also seek probation revocation for that violation. Butler v. State, 2014 WY 115, 334 P.3d 147,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       2014 Wyo. LEXIS 131
      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2014).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section did not permit the State to both revoke defendant's probation and subject him to administrative sanctions. The district court erred when it granted the State's petition to revoke probation because the violations contained in the petition had already been subject to administrative sanctions. Butler v. State, 2014 WY 115, 334 P.3d 147,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       2014 Wyo. LEXIS 131
      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2014).
     </p>
     <p>
      In the context of an intensive supervision program, if the State decides that a probationer who has violated a program rule should be subjected to administrative sanctions, then it shall not also seek probation revocation for that violation. The State may, however, forgo administrative sanctions and file a petition for probation revocation with the sentencing court. Umbach v. State, 2002 WY 42, 42 P.3d 1006,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       2002 Wyo. LEXIS 44
      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2002).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the State did not impose administrative sanctions for defendant's violations of the conditions of the intensive supervision program, and, instead, sought probation revocation, defendant had not already been administratively sanctioned for the violations the district court relied on in revoking his probation.

      that he had not been convicted since the case was on appeal was rejected.
      Defendant's criminal record and the substance abuse assessment supported
      the district court's finding that defendant was a qualified offender
      and in need of treatment. Marshall v. State, 2014 WY 168, 340 P.3d 283,

      Congress intended the terms “expunge” and “set aside,” as used in 18 U.S.C.S. § 921(a)(33)(B)(ii), to require that a state procedure completely remove the effects of a prior misdemeanor conviction; this section undoubtedly failed to meet that standard, and accordingly district court correctly dismissed Wyoming's suit against the federal ATF, in which Wyoming sought review of the ATF's finding that this section would not restore federal firearm rights because it did not satisfy the federal definition of expunge or set aside.

      Issues not raised on direct appeal, generally, would have been procedurally defaulted pursuant to Wyo. Stat.

P. 32(c)(3); thus, where the court undermined petitioner's ability to take a timely direct appeal, petitioner's failure to appeal could not be relied upon as grounds for summarily dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to this section.

      Where prior sexual conduct evidence was held inadmissible due to remoteness as well as untimeliness, and the defendant's counsel stated an experienced investigator had been used to inquire into the victim's background but was unable to uncover any evidence of prostitution, evidence that the defendant claimed existed, the defendant failed to demonstrate facts which occurred at his trial that supported his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, or that counsel improperly failed to raise errors made at trial.

      Petitioner's failure to raise his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his state postconviction petition within the time required by this section procedurally defaulted that claim, and a federal court would not entertain that claim.

     <p>
      Where a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has been raised and decided against the appellant in his direct appeal, he may not raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, based upon different allegations, in a petition for post-conviction relief because the claim is procedurally barred by this section. Therefore, a trial court did not err by dismissing a post-conviction relief petition where different allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel were raised on direct appeal and in the post-conviction petition.

      Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not procedurally barred from being raised for the first time on a petition for post-conviction review because he was represented by the same law firm at both trial and on appeal, and therefore the petitioner did not truly have an opportunity to make an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal.

      Issues not raised on direct appeal, generally, would have been procedurally defaulted pursuant to this section, however, a district court abrogated its duty to protect petitioner's right to appeal by failing to advise him of his right to appeal his conviction as mandated by Wyo. R. Crim. P. 32(c)(3); thus, where the court undermined petitioner's ability to take a timely direct appeal, petitioner's failure to appeal could not be relied upon as grounds for summarily dismissing his petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Wyo.

      Inmate's claim on his petition seeking postconviction relief that he was prejudiced pursuant to W.R.E. 404(b) by admission of evidence concerning his prior crimes, including victim impact evidence as to those crimes, during the sentencing phase of his trial was waived under this section when it was not raised on direct appeal. Furthermore, Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-14-101(b) clearly confines the state supreme court's role under the post-conviction relief act to those proceedings that resulted in a conviction, and not to sentencing proceedings.

      Because Wyoming applies a procedural bar to claims that could have been raised on direct appeal but were not, pursuant to Wyo. Stat.

      Even if a former inmate's pro se “petition to show cause why judgment was not void '' were to be construed as a motion for postconviction relief, the former inmate was too late in the request, where the former inmate filed the petition more than five years after he had been convicted.

      Without any facts to indicate that the inmate could have filed a viable petition for post-conviction relief, the supreme court could not determine that the inmate had been injured by the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations under this section; thus, the inmate's complaint was properly dismissed as he did not allege an actual injury.

      Appellate court could not review defendant's claim that the judgment
      and sentence entered after he pleaded guilty were illegal under this
      section due to the fact that he was not advised that his guilty pleas
      could result in the disqualification of his right to possess firearms
      pursuant to federal law because he raised it for the first time on
      appeal; moreover, even if the claim had been raised before the district
      court, it would have been barred by res judicata because the claim
      could have been raised on direct appeal and in defendant's petition
      for post-conviction relief.

      State prisoner's Fed. R. Civ.

      <p>
       The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trials of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

The Supreme Court of Wyoming's review of § 7-15-101, coupled with decisions from other courts interpreting similar Interstate Agreement on Detainers'

       Motion to dismiss a felony information was properly denied because the 180-day period under this section applied since defendant was the party who requested a disposition; moreover, he did not raise a timing issue until he filed an appellate brief. Defendant delayed Wyoming proceedings by 64 days by seeking a continuance of a preliminary hearing, and this delay was not unreasonable or not attributable to defendant; therefore, a jury trial was timely commenced in the 180-day period.

      Appellant inmate was improperly denied credit for the time spent at a community corrections facility (CCF) after a violation of probation because time in a CCF constituted official detention under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-18-108(a) and a person in a CCF could be charged with escape under this section.

      Where defendant was placed on probation and ordered to participate in Surveillance and Treatment of Offender Program (S.T.O.P.), defendant was not eligible for credit for the time spent in the program when her probation was revoked, since the defendant could not be charged with escape from S.T.O.P., and S.T.O.P. was not a community correctional center.

      Conviction for escape was reversed where cumulative effect of an instructional error and the prosecutor's misstatements Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 6-5-206(a)(i) created verdict that could not be trusted, because the jury had not been instructed that it had to find that appellant had acted voluntarily; even a general intent crime required a showing that the prohibited conduct was undertaken voluntarily.

       Sufficiency of Evidence. —

     </p>
     <p>
      When a defendant signed out of a community corrections facility, ostensibly to go to work when she no longer had a job, evidence was sufficient to show defendant was guilty of escape. Moreover, defendant failed to show that this section was unconstitutional; she failed to raise the constitutional issue before the district court, and she failed to show plain error. Jones v. State, 2006 WY 40, 132 P.3d 162,

      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2006).
     </p>
     <p>
      Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for escape. Although there was no direct evidence of where defendant was during the hours he was missing from a work site, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant left his place of employment.

      Supreme Court of Wyoming simply does not believe that the possible injury to a sexual offender from erroneous classification is significantly greater than any possible harm to the state. The ‘possible injury’ to the registrant is that he will be classified as a higher risk than what he actually is, with the attendant statutory consequences; the ‘possible harm’ to the State is a new sexual assault victim, with the attendant shattered life.

      In a case where defendant challenged his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, the Wyoming Sex Offender Registration Act did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state constitutions because the effects of the Act did not negate the legislature's intent to impose a regulatory scheme as it bore a rational connection to the goal of public safety by providing for identification of individuals convicted of sex offenses, and by making that information available to law enforcement agencies and the general public; and its requirements constituted a reasonable method of achieving the goal of public safety.

      Granting the State’s motion for relief under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) was not an abuse of discretion as Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-19-304(a)(i) clearly limited persons who could petition for relief for offenses specified in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-19-302(j) to persons who were adjudicated as delinquents of the offense, and petitioner was undeniably ineligible for relief from the reporting requirements under § 7-19-304(a)(i). Moreover, the decision to grant the State’s motion to vacate the judgment was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion. Gunsch v. State, 2019 WY 79, 444 P.3d 1278,

       Termination of duty to register. —

     <p>
      Potential sex offender registrant's duty to register was improperly terminated under a 10-year provision because he pled guilty to fourth degree sexual assault, which was akin to third degree sexual assault, an offense to which a 25-year termination provision applied; moreover, the state did not waive its right to appeal the termination decision by failing to attend two hearings.

       Statute Does Not Violate Due Process. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Former Wyoming Sex Offender Registration Act did not violate Due Process because, inter alia, the statutory scheme provides the offender with notice and a right to be heard, with both sides participating in the evidentiary hearing. The offender's somewhat limited rights are adequately protected by a requirement that the State prove any classification by a preponderance of the evidence. In re JJF v. State, 2006 WY 41, 132 P.3d 170,

       Risk of re-offense. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The State's evidence when considered under the mandatory factors of § 7-19-303(d) was insufficient even under a preponderance of the evidence standard for the district court to classify defendant as high risk, where the evidence presented by the State did not show that: (1) defendant's conduct was characterized by repetitive and compulsive behavior, (2) there were any psychological or psychiatric profiles to indicate a risk of recidivism, (3) defendant's recent behavior indicated a threat of re-offense, or (4) the defendant had made recent threats or expressions of intent to re-offend. Avery v. State (In re Avery), 2002 WY 87, 47 P.3d 973,

      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2002).
     </p>
     <p>
      District court did not err in finding it was more probable than not that sexual offender would reoffend because the quantum of evidence necessary to convince a court to classify a sexual offender as a moderate risk of reoffense was not very high and, inter alia, he was convicted of having sexual intercourse with a fifteen-year-old girl, to whom he had supplied alcohol. His probationary sentence was revoked due to a subsequent cocaine offense, and he was not receiving any counseling besides periodic NA attendance. In re JJF v. State, 2006 WY 41, 132 P.3d 170,

      Granting the State’s motion for relief under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(1) was not an abuse of discretion as Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-19-304(a)(i) clearly limited persons who could petition for relief for offenses specified in Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-19-302(j) to persons who were adjudicated as delinquents of the offense, and petitioner was undeniably ineligible for relief from the reporting requirements under § 7-19-304(a)(i). Moreover, the decision to grant the State’s motion to vacate the judgment was an appropriate exercise of judicial discretion. Gunsch v. State, 2019 WY 79, 444 P.3d 1278,

      Potential sex offender registrant's duty to register was improperly terminated under a 10-year provision because he pled guilty to fourth degree sexual assault, which was akin to third degree sexual assault, an offense to which a 25-year termination provision applied; moreover, the state did not waive its right to appeal the termination decision by failing to attend two hearings.

      In a case where defendant challenged his conviction for failure to register as a sex offender, the Wyoming Sex Offender Registration Act did not violate the ex post facto clauses of the federal or state constitutions because the effects of the Act did not negate the legislature's intent to impose a regulatory scheme as it bore a rational connection to the goal of public safety by providing for identification of individuals convicted of sex offenses, and by making that information available to law enforcement agencies and the general public; and its requirements constituted a reasonable method of achieving the goal of public safety.

      Trial court erred in considering a victim impact statement from defendant's daughter because such statements are limited to the victims of crimes for which a defendant is being sentenced, and the charge against defendant concerning the daughter had been dropped. Bitz v. State, 2003 WY 140, 78 P.3d 257,

     <p>
      Mere submission of a victim impact statement and presentence investigation report that contains statements from individuals who may be beyond those affected by the charged crimes does not without more constitute a procedural error in sentencing or prosecutorial misconduct; therefore, in a case involving sexual assault and indecent acts with a minor, error was not shown based on the fact that other statements were included.

      District court properly exercised its discretion in sentencing defendant, a high school teacher who was convicted of having had improper sexual relations with three students, because the fact that two of defendant's victims testified on defendant's behalf did not qualify their testimony as more credible, or warrant special status more so than the victim that did not testify.
