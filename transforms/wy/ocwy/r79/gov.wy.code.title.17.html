   commission or other regulatory authority and that no regulatory authority
   has confirmed the accuracy or determined the adequacy of any disclosure
   made to me relating to this offering.

   I am acquiring in this offering are illiquid, that the securities
   are subject to possible dilution, that there is no ready market for
   the sale of those securities, that it may be difficult or impossible
   for me to sell or otherwise dispose of this investment, and that,
   accordingly, I may be required to hold this investment indefinitely.

      I may be subject

   whether or not I have sold or otherwise disposed of my investment
   or received any dividends or other distributions from the issuer.

      By entering into

   is formed, and if this representation is subsequently shown to be
   false, the contract is void.

      If I resell any of the securities I am acquiring in this offering to a person that is not a Wyoming resident, within six (6) months after the closing of the offering, my contract with the issuer for the purchase of these securities is void.

   because it automatically took ownership of the property when it converted
   to a Wyoming limited liability partnership, amended its certificate
   of limited partnership to change its name, and withdrew its registration
   as a Colorado limited liability limited partnership. The ordinary
   meaning of a transfer by operation of law was one that did not involve
   an exchange of money or other equivalent consideration. N. Fork Land &amp; Cattle, LLLP v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 2015 WY 150, 362 P.3d 341, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 167</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

        Demand futility.—

       Limited partners could satisfy the demand rule by pleading futility because subsequent to the withdrawal of the sole general partner, the partnership agreement required the limited partnership to dissolve, wind up, and then terminate; after the general partner’s death, therefore, the limited partnership entered dissolution without a general partner, making the limited partners’ effort to cause the general partner to bring the action unlikely to succeed.

       An obligation of a limited partnership incurred while the limited partnership is a limited liability limited partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, is solely the obligation of the limited partnership. A general partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or acting as a general partner of a limited liability limited partnership. This subsection applies despite anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the election by all the partners to become a limited liability limited partnership. For purposes of this section, the obligation of a limited partnership under contract is deemed to arise at the time the limited partnership entered into the contract.

      Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all his partnership interest.

       District court properly dismissed limited partners’ action against deceased general partner’s estate because the complaint failed to state any facts entitling them to relief in a direct action since they sought relief for an injury to the limited partnership, not an injury individual to them; adherence to the derivative action requirement was especially appropriate under the circumstances where the proposed direct suit, if successful, would deprive at least six limited partners of recovery.

      To determine the rights and obligations of the members of LLC
   
   with regards to a member who dissociated from LLC, court examined the agreements entered into by members as the members were free to contract any provision they desired, so long as the provision did not conflict with the limited requirements of the Wyoming Limited Liability Company Acts; agreements include (1) articles of organization, (2) operating agreement, and (3) any other contract that sets forth the mutual obligationsLieberman v. Lieberman v. Wyoming.com LLC, 2004 WY 1, 82 P.3d 274, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      Where withdrawing member did not voluntarily forfeit his equity interest in a limited liability company (LLC),
   
   and where member failed to contractually provide for mandatory liquidation or a buyout, the member and the LLC were left in status quo—the other members or LLC were not required to buy out the member; it was the duty of a court to construe contracts made between parties, not to make a contract for them. Lieberman v. Wyoming.com LLC, 2004 WY 1, 82 P.3d 274, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      Given the absence of any contractual provision to the contrary, where withdrawing member of LLC did not voluntarily forfeit his equity interest there was no reason to treat the withdrawing member any differently from someone who bought into the LLC without becoming a member. Thus, the member was not a member of the LLC, but he maintained his equity interest and all rights and obligations attendant thereto. Lieberman v. Wyoming.com LLC, 2004 WY 1, 82 P.3d 274, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      Highest court did not require withdrawn LLC member's equity interest to be bought by LLC or members, as they did not contract for buyout and statute did not require it, and remanded for trial court to define his retained LLC equity rights. Lieberman v. Wyoming.com LLC, 2004 WY 1, 82 P.3d 274, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 2004).
     </p>
     <p>
      The member could only be divested of the member's ownership interest if the members of the LLC contracted for such divestment. Lieberman v. Wyoming.com LLC, 2004 WY 1, 82 P.3d 274, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

    </p>
    <p>
     2009 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 115, made numerous amendments to the Wyoming Business Corporation Act.
   Section § 4 of chapter 115 directed the Legislative Service Office to renumber the provisions of the Wyoming Business Corporation Act to correspond as nearly as possible to the numbering of the Model Business Corporations Act as amended through December, 2007, in accordance with the following:
    </p>
    <ol type="i">
     <li id="t17c16a01s0Aol1i">
      The renumbering shall conform with the provisions of W.S. 8-1-105;
     </li>
     <li id="t17c16a01s0Aol1ii">
      Provisions of the Wyoming Business Corporations Act shall be renumbered regardless of whether the provisions are contained within [2009 Wyoming Session Laws, Chapter 115];
     </li>
     <li id="t17c16a01s0Aol1iii">
      Internal citations within the Wyoming Business Corporations Act and within other provisions of Wyoming statutes shall be conformed;
     </li>
     <li id="t17c16a01s0Aol1iv">
      No action taken pursuant to this section shall alter the meaning;
     </li>
     <li id="t17c16a01s0Aol1v">
      Where it is not feasible to follow the numbering of the Model Business Corporations Act as amended through December, 2007, for sections and subsections, reference to the Model Act numbers shall be provided either in the section headings or in annotations following the section or subsection as appropriate.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     The Wyoming Business Corporation Act has been renumbered as directed by the Legislative Service Office pursuant to the above. The two Acts do not align completely as the numbering system of the Model Act is different from Wyoming Statutes under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.08.html#t08c01s8-1-105" target="_blank">8-1-105</a></cite>, which is required by the 2009 law to be followed in the renumbering process.

      Issue of directors' salaries raised by complaint that directors fraudulently diverted corporate funds. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     In a stockholder's derivative action, the fact that the defendants-directors had voted themselves salary increases, as well as the reasonableness of such compensation, lay properly within the knowledge of the directors. The plaintiff-stockholder complained that the directors had breached their fiduciary obligations by diverting funds from the corporation to its detriment. This allegation sufficed to inform the defendants that an issue existed as to the reasonableness of the executive salaries. Lynch v. Patterson, 701 P.2d 1126, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 493</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

      Reasonableness of increased executive salaries, due to “increased responsibilities,” not established. —

    </p>
    <p>
     In a stockholder's derivative action, the defendants-directors-corporate officers did not establish the reasonableness of their executive salaries, which were doubled as a result of “increased responsibilities,” in that they did not specify what these responsibilities entailed, presented no evidence of increased earnings, did not attempt to establish how their salaries compared with those of executives in similar businesses, nor explain increasing their salaries while refusing to declare a dividend for nonexecutive shareholders. Lynch v. Patterson, 701 P.2d 1126, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 493</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

     In a stockholder's derivative action, a director bore the burden of establishing that a contract under which he benefited also served the best interests of the corporation. Lynch v. Patterson, 701 P.2d 1126, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 493</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

      Directors receiving unlawful gain responsible for paying back amount due. —

    </p>
    <p>
     In a stockholder's derivative action, the court properly allocated the responsibility for payment of the amount due the minority stockholder resulting from improper fiduciary activities of the directors between the two directors receiving the unlawful gain; the stockholder's action against the third director, who was not a stockholder and who did not receive any improper payment, was properly dismissed. Lynch v. Patterson, 701 P.2d 1126, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 493</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

     In a stockholder's derivative suit, the court properly refused to order payment into the corporation, which would have simply returned the funds to the wrongdoers, the board of directors, who managed the corporation and held 70% of the stock, and instead permitted pro-rata recovery by the individual stockholder.

       In determining the value of fractional shares of stock, a district court erred when it applied a 30 percent minority discount because the value of the shares should not have been adversely impacted by the mere fact of being a minority shareholder. A discount for trapped-in capital gains was also inappropriate because it was premised on an action contemplated by a corporation subsequent to a reverse stock split, and there was a lack of an evidentiary basis to calculate the discount when the nature, timing, and details were speculative; moreover, it was error to omit corporate assets from the calculation of fair value.

       In a proceeding under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) to dissolve a corporation that has no shares listed on a national securities exchange or regularly traded in a market maintained by one (1) or more members of a national or affiliated securities association, the corporation may elect or, if it fails to elect, one (1) or more shareholders may elect to purchase all shares owned by the petitioning shareholder at the fair value of the shares. An election pursuant to this section shall be irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c16a14s0Cs17-16-1434ol1b">
       An election to purchase pursuant to this section may be filed with the court at any time within ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) or at such later time as the court in its discretion may allow. If the election to purchase is filed by one (1) or more shareholders, the corporation shall, within ten (10) days thereafter, give written notice to all shareholders, other than the petitioner. The notice must state the name and number of shares owned by the petitioner and the name and number of shares owned by each electing shareholder and must advise the recipients of their right to join in the election to purchase shares in accordance with this section. Shareholders who wish to participate must file notice of their intention to join in the purchase no later than thirty (30) days after the effective date of the notice to them. All shareholders who have filed an election or notice of their intention to participate in the election to purchase thereby become parties to the proceeding and shall purchase in proportion to their ownership of shares as of the date the first election was filed, unless they otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs. After an election has been filed by the corporation or one (1) or more shareholders, the proceeding under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) may not be discontinued or settled, nor may the petitioning shareholder sell or otherwise dispose of his shares, unless the court determines that it would be equitable to the corporation and the shareholders, other than the petitioner, to permit such discontinuance, settlement, sale or other disposition.

      <li id="t17c16a14s0Cs17-16-1434ol1c">
       If, within sixty (60) days of the filing of the first election, the parties reach agreement as to the fair value in terms of purchase of the petitioner’s shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase of petitioner’s shares upon the terms and conditions agreed to by the parties.

       If the parties are unable to reach an agreement as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the court, upon application of any party, shall stay the W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) proceedings and determine the fair value of the petitioner’s shares as of the day before the date on which the petition under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii) was filed or as of such other date as the court deems appropriate under the circumstances.

       Upon determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase upon such terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, where necessary in the interest of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded, and, if the shares are to be purchased by the shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating petitioner’s shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court should attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that the holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, no interest shall be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under W.S. 17-16-1430(a)(ii)(B) or (D), it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and of any experts employed by him.

       Upon entry of an order under subsection (c) or (e) of this section, the court shall dismiss the petition to dissolve the corporation under W.S. 17-16-1430, and the petitioning shareholder shall no longer have any rights or status as a shareholder of the corporation, except the right to receive the amounts awarded to him by the order of the court which shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other judgment.

      <li id="t17c16a14s0Cs17-16-1434ol1g">
       The purchase order pursuant to subsection (e) of this section shall be made within ten (10) days after the date the order becomes final unless before that time the corporation files with the court a notice of its intention to adopt articles of dissolution pursuant to W.S. 17-16-1402 and 17-16-1403, which articles must then be adopted and filed within fifty (50) days thereafter.

The corporation may elect to incorporate by reference in the articles of continuance its basic corporate charter or other authorization which had been adopted by the corporation in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the same to continue to act as the articles of incorporation of the corporation, provided, however, that such basic corporate charter or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make the same conform to the laws of Wyoming and to the provisions of the articles of continuance.

The laws of Wyoming shall apply to a corporation continuing under this act to the same extent as if the corporation had been incorporated under the laws of Wyoming from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuation under this act by the secretary of state to the corporation. When a foreign corporation is continued as a corporation under this act, such continuance shall not affect the corporation’s ownership of its property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments, or any other characteristics or aspects of the corporation and its existence.

Continuance under this act does not deprive a stockholder of any right or privilege that he claims under, or relieve the stockholder of any liability in respect of, an issued share.

      Unrestricted grants may be used as deemed best. —
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     If grants made to a charitable corporation are absolute and no purpose is expressed for which they are made, the property may be used in such manner as those in control deem best for the accomplishment of the corporate purposes, and these purposes are determined by the charter and the statutes relating thereto. Cody v. Buffalo Bill Memorial Ass'n, 64 Wyo. 468, 196 P.2d 369, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1948).
    </p>
    <p>
     And there is presumption that grants were intended for charitable uses.
   
   An implied trust, enforceable in the courts, arises that they shall be so used. Cody v. Buffalo Bill Memorial Ass'n, 64 Wyo. 468, 196 P.2d 369, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

     Where a charitable corporation transferred real property held by it in a charitable trust and subject to certain conditions, in order to relieve itself of financial difficulty, the transfers were held to be void and reconveyance was ordered, since the transfers could only have been made with the consent and approval of a court of equity in the absence of any authority in this section to dispose of real property held on a charitable trust. Cody v. Buffalo Bill Memorial Ass'n, 64 Wyo. 468, 196 P.2d 369, <cite class="wy_code">1948 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1948).

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c19a03s17-19-304ol1b" target="_self">17-19-304(b)</a></cite> was not applicable in that the action was not one to enjoin any corporate act and thus the members' claims were barred under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c19a03s17-19-304ol1a" target="_self">17-19-304(a)</a></cite>.

       Association members' ultra vires claim against appellee former association managers was not only not cogent, but frivolous because the exception of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c19a03s17-19-304ol1b" target="_self">17-19-304(b)</a></cite> was not applicable in that the action was not one to enjoin any corporate act and thus the members' claims were barred under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c19a03s17-19-304ol1a" target="_self">17-19-304(a)</a></cite>. Furthermore, because the claims were brought in bad faith and appellants failed to cite the relevant statutory provision, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17c19a06s17-19-630ol1d" target="_self">17-19-630(d)</a></cite>, appellees were entitled to reasonable expenses, including counsel fees incurred in defending that claim.

     Prior to the approval of the Uniform Partnership Act, partnership, more than any other subject connected with business law, was fraught with uncertainty. Coady v. Batchelder, 79 Wyo. 447, 335 P.2d 443, <cite class="wy_code">1959 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1959).

     Partnership cases decided in any jurisdiction prior to the adoption of the Uniform Partnership Act are of slight assistance, because they deal with the common law, while we are bound by statute.

       Contractor’s spouse was dismissed from litigation involving the contractor’s home improvement business because there was no competent evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the married couple agreed to share in the profits of the business or in the management or control of the business—both of which were essential to establish partnership formation. There also was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the spouse held the spouse as a purported partner of the business. Norris v. Besel, 2019 WY 58, 442 P.3d 60, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 58</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

       It is the generally accepted rule that a partnership or a joint adventure cannot be inferred when the understanding with reference to the undertaking does not contemplate a mutual promise to share, in the fashion agreed upon, in the profits derived from the venture and the losses sustained in its operation. The absence of such a mutual interest is conclusive evidence that a partnership or joint adventure does not exist. True v. Hi-Plains Elevator Mach., 577 P.2d 991, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo.

       When a partner acquires property contrary to his fiduciary duty, he is held to be a trustee of the property for the partnership's benefit. Lutz v. Schmillen, 899 P.2d 861, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 121</cite> (Wyo. 1995), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 140</cite> (Wyo.

      </p>
      <p>
       While it is acknowledged that the partnership relationship does not preclude a partner's procurement of realty interests in his own right and with his own funds, the partner can do so only as long as the partnership does not suffer any disadvantage and the partner who is making the purchase does not reap any individual advantage from his position as a partner. Lutz v. Schmillen, 899 P.2d 861, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 121</cite> (Wyo. 1995), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 140</cite> (Wyo.

       When a partner obtains financing for the development of real property in the course of a plan which had been originally pursued by the partnership for the same purpose, excluding other partners from participating further in the originally intended project, the partner has intercepted a partnership opportunity in breach of his fiduciary duty to the partnership.

       This section evidences a presumption that additional amounts paid by a partner, over and above the capital contributions recited in the partnership agreement or agreed to, are presumed to be loans to the partnership, with interest payable from the date of the advance; therefore, district court's calculation of dissociated partner's share was improper because the cash advances by the other partners were to be treated as loans where the partnership agreement was silent on the matter.

        Liquidation value. —

      </p>
      <p>
       According to the Wyoming Supreme Court, the meaning of liquidation value in subsection (b) of this section is best understood by comparing it to the other method provided. When contrasted with ‘going concern value’ it is clear that ‘liquidation value’ simply means the sale of the separate assets rather than the value of the business as a whole. Additionally, under either valuation method, subsection (b) directs that the sale price be determined on the basis of the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell, and with knowledge of all relevant facts. The legislature chose to supplement the Uniform Laws version of this provision by adding this sentence, lending added significance to this language. This ‘willing buyer’ and ‘willing seller’ language does not present a novel legal concept, as it sets forth precisely what has long been the legal definition or test of ‘fair market value.’ ‘Fair market value’ is generally defined as the amount at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.

       Where it is contemplated that a business will continue, it is not appropriate to assume an immediate liquidation with its attendant transactional costs and taxes. Under subsection (b) of this section, purely hypothetical costs of sale are not a required deduction in valuing partnership assets. Warnick v.

       District court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony from an expert appraiser concerning the hypothetical costs of the sale of partnership property, as they were not pertinent to the task of calculating the buyout price of a dissociated partner's interest under this section; ‘liquidation value’ meant fair market value, not the net value following a sale, when there was no evidence of any actual, intended, or pending sale at the time of dissociation, and the assets were not liquidated but were, instead, retained by the partnership.

       Reviewing court overruled the claim that the son became a certificate holder of the trust upon the testator's execution of the transfer document, because pursuant to the trust provisions, a transfer was effective only when a new certificate was issued and recorded, and it was undisputed that this procedure was not followed.

       The provisions of the application for continuance may without expressly so stating, vary from the provisions of the statutory trust’s certificate of trust or governing instrument or equivalent, if the variation is one which a statutory trust organized under the Wyoming Statutory Trust Act could effect by way of amendment to its certificate of trust or governing instrument. Upon issuance of a certificate of continuance by the secretary of state, the certificate of continuance shall be the certificate of trust of the continued statutory trust. The statutory trust may elect to incorporate by reference in and attachment to the application for continuance its original certificate of trust or other authorization which had been adopted by the statutory trust in the foreign jurisdiction, in order to permit the original to continue to act as the certificate of trust of the statutory trust provided, however, that the original certificate of trust or other authorization shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it conform to the laws of this state.

The laws of this state shall apply to a statutory trust continuing under this chapter to the same extent as if the statutory trust had been organized under the laws of this state from and after the issuance of a certificate of continuance under this chapter by the secretary of state to the statutory trust. When a foreign statutory trust is continued as a statutory trust under this chapter, the continuance shall not affect the statutory trust’s ownership of its property or liability for any existing obligations, causes of action, claims, pending or threatened prosecutions or civil or administrative actions, convictions, rulings, orders, judgments or any other characteristics or aspects of the statutory trust and its existence.

       Sole member of a limited liability company (LLC) was held liable for the LLC's contractual obligations because piercing the LLC's veil was appropriate under this section; the court looked to undercapitalization and the intermingling of business and finances. Even though there was no classic fraud, the decision to pierce the veil and hold the member responsible for a debt for services which benefitted it was not clearly erroneous.

       Veil of a limited liability company may be pierced under exceptional circumstances when: (1) the limited liability company is not only owned, influenced and governed by its members, but the required separateness has ceased to exist due to misuse of the limited liability company; and (2) the facts are such that an adherence to the fiction of its separate existence would, under the particular circumstances, lead to injustice, fundamental unfairness, or inequity. This test is fact-driven and flexible, and it focuses on whether the limited liability company has been operated as a separate entity as contemplated by statute, or whether the member has instead misused the entity in an inequitable manner to injure the plaintiff.

       District court erred in finding, inter alia, that a doctor breached his fiduciary duties as a manager of a limited liability company (LLC) by appropriating an opportunity and competing with the LLC in violation of his statutory duty of care and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing because the court did not make any findings on whether the LLC had an actual or expected interest in an Eye Center business, the LLC did not have a written contract with the Eye Center that gave it the exclusive rights to provide anesthesiology services, and there were questions of fact about whether the doctor competed with the LLC and whether it justifiably expected to continue receiving revenues from the Eye Center.

      <p>
       Members of the dissolved limited liability company (LLC) did not automatically retain its assets as their own, as debtors'
   holding and distribution of these assets was strictly controlled by the Wyoming Statutes; the LLC was required to apply its assets to discharge its obligations to creditors, and only after the creditors claims were discharged, and in the event that there was a surplus, were debtors provided for distribution of the assets in accordance with this section, and then only in the form of “money.” The collateral that secured the promissory note signed by the members of the LLC, as an LLC, in favor of the bank, was not property of the estate; therefore, the bank did not violate the automatic stay.
