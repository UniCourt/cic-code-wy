   <p>
    Many of the provisions in this title as it appeared before the 1985 revision were originally enacted in the Wyoming Probate Code (Laws 1890-91, ch. 70). Several similar provisions appear in the 1985 revision.

     Revision of title. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Laws 1985, ch. 226, § 1, revised this title by repealing and recreating former §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c01a01s3-1-101" target="_self">3-1-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c05a01s3-5-107" target="_self">3-5-107</a></cite> as present §§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c01a01s3-1-101" target="_self">3-1-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c05a01s3-5-103" target="_self">3-5-103</a></cite>.Sections <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c06s3-6-101" target="_self">3-6-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c06s3-6-119" target="_self">3-6-119</a></cite> were unaffected by this act.
   </p>
   <p>
    No detailed explanation of the changes made by Laws 1985, ch. 226, has been attempted, but, where appropriate, annotations to cases decided under former provisions have been placed under comparable sections where it was felt they would be useful. For tables of revised and renumbered sections, see Volume 11 of the Wyoming Statutes Annotated.
   </p>
   <p>
    Laws 1985, ch. 226, § 3, provides: “This act shall govern all proceedings commenced after the effective date of this act. It shall also govern further proceedings in cases pending on the effective date hereof unless the court determines such application is not feasible or shall work an injustice, in which event the former procedures shall apply.”
   </p>
   <p>
    Laws 1985, ch. 226, § 4, makes the act effective on July 1, 1985.

       District court erred in vacating the grandmother's 2005 and 2006 guardianship appointment orders as void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, although the guardianship statutes did not authorize the appointment of a guardian for an unborn child, there was no question that the district court could have appointed a guardian for the child to take effect upon her birth; the district court had jurisdiction to act on the 2005 guardianship petition, but erred in its exercise of that jurisdiction; and the 2006 order extending guardianship was effectively a new appointment of the grandmother as the child's guardian as the district court made new findings of the need for the guardianship and outlined the guardian's obligations in detail.

       Trial court
   did not err in appointing a guardian because the 70-year-old ward,
   who had been diagnosed with dementia, was living under horrifying
   conditions in a house filled with hoarded articles and trash; his
   home had been without running water since 2006 and had no toilet
   or
   shower facilities. Sands v. Brown (In re Sands), 2013 WY 60, 301 P.3d 128, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 64</cite> (Wyo. 2013).

      <p>
       District court erred in vacating the grandmother's 2005 and 2006 guardianship appointment orders as void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because, although the guardianship statutes did not authorize the appointment of a guardian for an unborn child, there was no question that the district court could have appointed a guardian for the child to take effect upon her birth; the district court had jurisdiction to act on the 2005 guardianship petition, but erred in its exercise of that jurisdiction; and the 2006 order extending guardianship was effectively a new appointment of the grandmother as the child's guardian as the district court made new findings of the need for the guardianship and outlined the guardian's obligations in detail.

       District court did not err in appointing stepsons'
   stepmother, rather than the stepsons'
   grandparents, as a guardian for the children because the stepsons'
   father had died and the mother was unfit. Further, the appointment of the stepmother was in the children's best interests; therefore, the trial court was allowed to disregard the father's wishes.

       Use of the
   language, “likely to have” and “may,” in this section expresses a
   legislative concern with even the potential of a conflict between
   the interests of a guardian and ward; because the nieces' potential
   to inherit from their uncle need not be shown to be of a particular
   magnitude or immediacy to be a disqualifying interest, the district
   court did not err in finding that the nieces had a conflict of interest
   that disqualified them from serving as their uncle's guardians. Utley v. Lankford (In re Lankford), 2013 WY 65, 301 P.3d 1092, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 69</cite> (Wyo. 2013).

      <p>
       Because the
   district court could only consider that the uncle might die penniless
   or change his will, thus affecting the amount of the nieces' inheritance,

        Conveyance of Property Requires Court Approval. —

       Where a grantor's conservators filed suit to set aside a previous conveyance of property by the grantor to himself and a grantee at joint tenants and where they subsequently executed a deed conveying the grantor's remaining interest in the property to himself as a tenant in common in an effort to destroy the joint tenancy, the conveyance by the conservators was not valid because an exchange or sale of real estate was something that could not be done without court approval. While the conservators applied for court approval after the fact, the grantor died before court approval was given; the grantor's death rendered approval impossible because, upon the grantor's death, all title to the property vested in the grantee as the joint tenant.

      </li>

     <p>
      STATE OF WYOMING STATUTORY FORM POWER OF ATTORNEY IMPORTANT INFORMATION This power of attorney authorizes another person (your agent) to make decisions concerning your property for you (the principal). Your agent will be able to make decisions and act with respect to your property (including your money) whether or not you are able to act for yourself. The meaning of authority over subjects listed on this form is explained in the Uniform Power of Attorney Act, W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c09a01s3-9-101" target="_self">3-9-101</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t03c09a04s3-9-403" target="_self">3-9-403</a></cite>. This power of attorney does not authorize the agent to make health care decisions for you. You should select someone you trust to serve as your agent. Unless you specify otherwise, generally the agent’s authority will continue until you die or revoke the power of attorney or the agent resigns or is unable to act for you. Your agent is entitled to reasonable compensation unless you state otherwise in the Special Instructions. This form provides for designation of one (1) agent. If you wish to name more than one (1) agent you may name a coagent in the Special Instructions.

If your agent is unable or unwilling to act for you, your power of attorney will end unless you have named a successor agent. You may also name a second successor agent.
