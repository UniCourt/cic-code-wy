       The term “this act,” referred to in this section, means, literally, Laws 1982, ch. 75, as amended by Laws 1983, ch. 171.

      <p>
       Although, at the time he pleaded guilty to grand larceny, the defendant was informed that he could receive a sentence of up to 10 years under former law, his sentence, which took place after the effective date of the new Criminal Code, should have been under the provisions of the new code, inasmuch as the legislative intent is to have the law in effect prior to July 1, 1983 control all aspects of the prosecution of a crime in which any of its elements occurred prior to that date, with a single exception — any original sentence imposed after July 1, 1983 must be the lesser of that provided for the crime where the new code and the old code diverge.

      <p>
       The defendant, who was properly charged with, and convicted of, manslaughter, but who contended throughout his trial and appeal that he should have been charged with vehicular homicide, was properly sentenced under the manslaughter statute. Both the previous (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c04a01s6-4-107" target="_self">6-4-107</a></cite>) and the current (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a01s6-2-105" target="_self">6-2-105</a></cite>) statutes proscribing manslaughter provide for a sentence of up to 20 years in the state penitentiary. The defendant's interpretation and application of subsection (c) was inappropriate; he was never charged with or convicted of vehicular homicide. Sodergren v. State, 715 P.2d 170, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 485</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

      <p>
       Inasmuch as the defendant's sentence was three to seven years, the sentence was within “the lesser” of the penalties provided for the crime of forgery under the present Criminal Code and the crime of forgery as defined when the crime was committed in 1982. Accordingly, the argument that subsection (c) made improper the sentence was without merit. Binger v. State, 712 P.2d 349, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 444</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

       Although the district court erred by instructing the jury as to common law parental duties that were not encompassed within the charged crime of felony murder based on child abuse, the error was harmless because the completed verdict form showed juror unanimity as to defendant's guilt on all of the theories properly alleged; the judgment and sentence had to be amended to reflect the fact that only one charge was brought, that defendant was bound over and arraigned and pled to only one charge, and that he was therefore convicted of only one charge.

        Laws 2021, ch. 109 § 6 contained a scrivener’s error that inadvertently repealed Laws 2020, ch. 114 in its entirety. Drafting practices dictate that the repeal should have been limited to the noncodified § 1. The effect of the scrivener's error was to repeal the original legislative enactment of laws codified in the Wyoming Statutes. The text in this section shown in bold and bracketed is text that was affected by the repeal of the original legislative enactment. The bold and bracketed emphasis is included to provide context and clarity to the legislative history of this section.

       Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of aggravated homicide by vehicle as the evidence did not show that she acted recklessly because she never admitted she was fatigued, let alone that she consciously disregarded any fatigue; she told a trooper that she did not think she fell asleep; there was direct evidence that she was not impaired; evidence that she failed to steer and brake both before and after striking the sedan, coupled with her lack of knowledge of what happened might support a reasonable inference she fell asleep, but it did not support the jury’s conclusion that she acted recklessly; and neither trooper testified that defendant ever suggested she was fatigued or not well-rested.

       In order to demonstrate malicious intent for second-degree murder, the State must show a heightened form of recklessness as compared to that required for manslaughter because the State must show that the defendant acted recklessly under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life; however, the trial court was not required to define “recklessly” to the jury as the formulation of the heightened standard of recklessness adequately distinguished second-degree murder from manslaughter; thus, the district court’s omission of a definition of “recklessly” or “recklessly under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life” was not plainly erroneous.

       In sentencing
   for being felon in possession of a firearm, a Wyoming conviction for
   threatening to use a drawn deadly weapon qualified as a crime of violence
   under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.1 because the Wyoming
   statute requires that a weapon be “drawn,” meaning in
   a position for use when the threat was made. United States v. Devries, 708 Fed. Appx. 956, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 18335 (10th Cir. 2017).

       A structure “in which a person may reasonably be expected to be present” is one that is intended to be occupied and would be perceived by any reasonable person to be an occupied structure, although unoccupied at the time.

      <p>
       An instruction did not clearly and concisely inform the jury that “recklessly” was an element of involuntary manslaughter, in that it did not advise the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, they had to find that he acted with “conscious disregard.” To act with “conscious disregard” implies intentional acts despite knowledge of the risk, while acting with “wanton disregard” (the language used in the instruction) implies acts done without conscious regard or heedlessly. Therefore, the instruction only created confusion in the minds of the jurors as to what actions constituted the crime in question. Vigil v. State, 859 P.2d 659, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 148</cite> (Wyo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recklessness, as defined for involuntary manslaughter, involves a gross deviation from reasonableness, not a lack of necessity to threaten deadly force; thus, the giving of instructions that threats with a drawn deadly weapon or pointing a firearm at another amounts to recklessness, unless reasonably necessary for self-defense, was reversible error. Olson v. State, 960 P.2d 1019, <cite class="wy_code">1998 Wyo. LEXIS 111</cite> (Wyo. 1998).

       Evidence was sufficient to support jury's conclusion that defendant was acting recklessly at time of fatal accident, where he chose to drive his vehicle after being awake for twenty-four hours, smoking marijuana, and drinking beer and rum.

      </p>
      <p>
       Affirmative defense of self-defense was not available to defendant charged with vehicular homicide, since crime involved a reckless act, rather than an intentional act. Duran v.

      </p>
      <p>
       Considering defendants' repeated failure to accept the remedial parenting advice and services of medical and educational professionals, and the evidence indicating their understanding of their children's needs, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendants acted recklessly through their conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm to their children.

       Where defendant was convicted of one count of aggravated assault and battery after he waved a flare gun around during an altercation at a bar, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the flare gun was capable of firing a missile using an explosive charge and was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury where the investigating officer testified that the flare gun was regularly used to scare elk and deer out of haystacks and where he explained that, to use the gun, one placed a bomb or ammunition into the barrel, placed a primer underneath the hammer, and then cocked the hammer and that, when fired, the gun shot the projectile approximately 50 to 60 yards before it explodes like a very large firecracker. Further, the officer stated that, if the projectile were to hit a person, it would absolutely cause severe injury and possibly death; this testimony aptly demonstrates that the flare gun was capable of firing a missile using an explosive charge and was capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.

      </p>
      <p>
       To convict one of aiding and abetting the commission of a substantive offense, it is necessary to prove that the crime in question was committed by someone and that the person charged as an aider and abettor associated himself and participated in the accomplishment and success of the criminal venture. Goldsmith v. Cheney, 447 F.2d 624, 1971 U.S. App. LEXIS 8271 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1971); Hawkes v. State, 626 P.2d 1041, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 325</cite> (Wyo. 1981); Haight v.

      <p>
       The test for determining whether the acts of a participant in a crime constitute those of an accomplice is whether or not the participant could also be charged with the identical offense as that committed by the principal. Wheeler v. State, 691 P.2d 599, <cite class="wy_code">1984 Wyo. LEXIS 349</cite> (Wyo. 1984).

      </p>
      <p>
       If two persons engaged in a crime are aiding or abetting each other in what they do, a previous understanding is not necessary to be shown in order to render each of them accountable for the other's acts. Espy v. State, 54 Wyo. 291, 92 P.2d 549, <cite class="wy_code">1939 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1939); Lujan v. State, 423 P.2d 388, <cite class="wy_code">1967 Wyo. LEXIS 138</cite> (Wyo. 1967).

       A defendant must share the criminal intent of the principal if he is to be found guilty as an aider and abettor, but the law does not require that the defendant possess the identical intent as the principal.

       Although a defendant's presence at the time and place of the crime does not establish guilt as an aider, abettor or principal, an intent to engage in the criminal venture may be shown by the relationship of the parties and by their conduct before and after the offense.

      <p>
       A plea of guilty to possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance, with the express reservation of the right to appeal the constitutional issues arising from the search of the defendant's premises, was not permissible. Because of this, the case was reversed and remanded to the district court for the taking of a proper plea. However, since the parties intended the defendant's stipulation to be a waiver of the necessity for the prosecution, in the trial of another charged with aiding and abetting, to establish the elements of the substantive offense, or to be an admission of the violation and to be so considered as part of the evidence, the conditional guilty plea did not alter the status or aspect of what occurred at the trial of the aider and abettor, where, although no evidence, other than the guilty plea, was introduced as to a link between the substance seized and the defendant's intent, the aider and abettor was properly convicted.

       In a case where defendant asserted a defense of self-induced intoxication
   under this section to the offense of unlawful possession with intent

       Defendant was properly sentenced consecutively for the crimes for which defendant was convicted because defendant failed to demonstrate that the statutes for aggravated assault and battery and for attempted second-degree murder were unconstitutionally vague, either on their face or as applied to the facts of defendant's case.

       Defendant's convictions for aggravated assault and battery with a deadly weapon and attempted second degree murder—which were both premised upon defendant driving a vehicle through a yard and almost striking the victim—did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy in that malice, an element of attempted second degree murder, did not necessarily include proof of the use of a deadly weapon, an element of aggravated assault and battery with a deadly weapon.

       Defendant
   set a fire with an accelerant in the middle of the night directly
   outside of the victim's motel room, from which she had no clear means

       Denial of mistrial was proper; although officer’s use of the word “meth” violated the order in limine, a curative instruction was given and there was no reasonable possibility the verdict would have been more favorable to defendant had “meth” not been mentioned, as the jury carefully analyzed the evidence and convicted defendant of attempted aggravated robbery based on evidence that he pointed a gun at the victim and demanded his keys.

       In a case in which defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter pursuant to a plea agreement, the district court did not err in sentencing defendant to two consecutive counts of 17 to 20 years of incarceration; while defendant's lack of prior criminal history, reports of his good character, alcohol dependence and abuse at the time of the crimes, and history of mental health issues were valid considerations in determining the reasonableness and proportionality of an appropriate sentence, so, too, were the aggravating factors presented by the prosecutor and the seriousness of defendant's conduct.

      </p>
      <p>
       In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction for felony attempted interference with a peace officer, the Supreme Court concluded the evidence was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that a police officer was lawfully engaged in the performance of his official duties because defendant was a danger to himself, and that tackling defendant was not excessive force under the circumstances. In addition, the jury could reasonably infer from the evidence that defendant acted with the requisite specific intent when he attempted to disarm the officer by pulling on the officer’s gun with both hands.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's attempt to commit second-degree murder was complete when he stabbed victim
   
   with the ice pick; that he stabbed her eight more times leaves little doubt but that he had attempted to kill her. If calling an ambulance saved her life, it also saved defendant from being convicted of the crime of murder and perhaps a more severe sentence, but, with respect to the attempt, that crime was complete, as he had passed beyond the point at which abandonment was legally possible. Accordingly, he was not entitled to an instruction on that defense. Ramirez v. State, 739 P.2d 1214, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 470</cite> (Wyo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Elements of attempted sexual assault are different from sexual assault in first degree
   
   because of the requirement of a specific intent in the attempt statute. Sexual assault in the first degree is a general intent crime, and if the lesser offense has elements not included in the greater offense, no lesser included offense instruction is warranted.

       In a prosecution for attempted first-degree sexual assault, the trial court's failure to instruct the jury on the statutory definition of “substantial step towards commission of the crime” was error, but not plain error, where the state's proof showed that the defendant attempted to force penetration on his sleeping victim. Compton v. State, 931 P.2d 936, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

       In instructing the jury, the trial court did not err by combining the attempt elements with the second-degree sexual assault elements; the instruction clearly set out all of the elements that the jury needed to find in order to convict.

       Trial court did not commit plain error in instructing the jury on the elements of attempted first degree murder, where it adequately informed the jury of the elements of each crime and the circumstances that had to exist in order to find defendant guilty of those crimes.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an attempted first degree murder case, the trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Taken as a whole, a jury could conclude that the acts that defendant completed before being apprehended by the police, such as having a verbal and physical altercation with the victim, attempting to run over the victim with his car, retrieving his gun, and returning to the scene of the altercation, constituted a substantial step toward the commission of first degree murder.

       In a trial for attempted kidnapping by removal, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included misdemeanor offense of attempted false imprisonment because attempted false imprisonment is not a lesser-included offense to attempt to commit kidnapping where the purported criminal conduct involved only an attempted removal of the victim with the intent to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize her.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-502ol1ai" target="_self">6-2-502(a)(i)</a></cite>, it did not commit plain error where the instruction was not inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of attempt, and the instructions fairly and adequately covered the relevant issues and correctly stated the law.

       In a case in which defendant was charged with aggravated assault, defendant failed to establish that either plain error or an abuse of discretion occurred when the district court did not give an instruction defining attempt.

       Although the district court erred by failing to define substantial step for the jury and by including the concept of attempt in the elements of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor when instructing the jury, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the instructions as defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to object because the evidence against him was overwhelming as defendant’s statements over several weeks confirmed he had the specific intent to inflict sexual intrusion upon the victim and his actions were strongly corroborative of the firmness of his intention to complete the crime of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor.

       On plain error review, defendant was entitled to reversal of his conviction for attempted second degree murder because the trial court violated Wyo. R.

       In defendant's attempted second degree murder case, the court's error in failing to properly advise defendant pursuant to Wyo. R. Crim. P. 11 was not harmless because, had the court recited the minimum and maximum penalties at the change of plea hearing, the fact that the State could not recommend a maximum sentence of 20 years would have become obvious. Thus, the court's acceptance of a plea agreement which included an illegal sentence recommendation further undermined the validity of defendant's no contest pleas.

       Where defendant was convicted of conspiracy in Wyoming in connection with methamphetamine manufacturing in Colorado and asserted that the only thing that occurred in Wyoming was the purchase of cold tablets, which was not a crime, and all other actions transpired in Colorado, the Wyoming courts still had jurisdiction because the conspiracy continued and was reaffirmed in Wyoming, and the overt act, which was central to the purpose of the conspiracy, occurred in Wyoming.

Moreover, appropriate inferences from all the evidence were that the inmate intended that an escape would occur and intended that the guard be killed during the attempted escape. Harlow v.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of conspiracy to commit aggravated burglary, aggravated robbery, and aggravated assault and battery as the State presented evidence that defendant and the accomplice agreed to use the gun during the incident at the golf course because the golf course’s manager testified that after he hit defendant in the head with the flashlight, defendant turned and ran away; the manager then heard someone saying to shoot him; seconds later, the manager heard a gunshot and saw a muzzle flash; and it was reasonable for the jury to infer that the accomplice would have only said to shoot the manager if he knew defendant had a gun in his possession.

       Evidence was sufficient to support the jury's findings that there was a conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and battery and that defendant acted with specific intent; although the plan to beat up a third person may have been crude and ill-conceived and entered into only after a long drinking bout, there was evidence that the “plan” to beat up a business owner using an axe handle rose to the level of a conspiracy, and that defendant acted with specific intent to further the plan.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery because defendant confessed that he and others agreed to contact the victim to arrange a meeting with the victim to rob him, the group obtained knives to use as leverage in the proposed robbery, and after meeting with the victim, the robbery plan was executed. The conspiracy included a contingency plan that if the victim resisted, they would kill him; that circumstance came to pass.

       There was
   sufficient evidence to support a conviction for conspiracy to commit
   robbery because, even though the case was circumstantial, the jury
   was justified to believe that the circumstances pointed toward the
   fact that defendant was in agreement with his brother to snatch a
   purse in a parking lot. Defendant was in the parking lot with his
   brother when the victim was robbed, a police chase ensued, defendant
   and his brother ran from police, and two guns, the purse, and a bandana
   were found where defendant and his brother ran. Oldman v. State, 2015 WY 121, 359 P.3d 964, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 139</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In defendant's murder case, this section was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, where the record clearly showed that defendant was well aware of the trial court's ability to impose either life or life without parole. Defendant
   had a meaningful opportunity to argue to the trial court that life without parole was inappropriate and, in fact, did so at sentencing.
   Teniente v. State, 2007 WY 165, 169 P.3d 512, <cite class="wy_code">2007 Wyo. LEXIS 177</cite> (Wyo. 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court properly denied defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence because he did not met his burden of proving that the statute under which he was sentence was cruel or unusual where he was 18 at the time he committed a double homicide, his sentence to two consecutive life sentences for first-degree murder was effectively a sentence of life without the possibility of parole, and the defining the age of majority as 19 did not do so for purposes of determining criminal culpability. Nicodemus v. State, 2017 WY 34, 392 P.3d 408, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 34</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

        Wyoming's mandatory identical sentencing structure for accessory and principal actors in felony murder, which imposed a mandatory life sentence, did not violate the Eighth Amendment when applied to juveniles given federal judicial precedent that refrained from extending those protections to accomplices.

       </p>
       <p>
        The elements of the lesser offense of murder in the second degree are identical to part of the elements of murder in the first degree; both contain the elements of the killing of a human being with malice and purpose. State v. Selig, 635 P.2d 786, <cite class="wy_code">1981 Wyo. LEXIS 383</cite> (Wyo. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        On information charging all elements of murder in the first degree as well as elements of second degree and on a plea of guilty defendant could be sentenced for second-degree murder. Hollibaugh v. Hehn, 13 Wyo. 269, 79 P. 1044, <cite class="wy_code">1905 Wyo. LEXIS 10</cite> (Wyo. 1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where indictment charges assault with intent to commit murder in the first degree, defendant may be convicted of assault with intent to commit murder in the second degree, as the latter is an included offense. Brantley v. State, 9 Wyo. 102, 61 P. 139, <cite class="wy_code">1900 Wyo. LEXIS 7</cite> (Wyo. 1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        But felony murder is not divisible into lesser degrees
   
   of homicide since the necessary elements of first degree murder — premeditation, deliberation and malice aforethought — are imputed in felony murder by a conclusive presumption. Richmond v. State, 554 P.2d 1217, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 215</cite> (Wyo. 1976), reh'g denied, 558 P.2d 509, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 323</cite> (Wyo. 1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Manslaughter is not an offense necessarily included in robbery and therefore is not a lesser included offense of the crime of felony murder. Richmond v. State, 554 P.2d 1217, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 215</cite> (Wyo. 1976), reh'g denied, 558 P.2d 509, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 323</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

         Differences in first degree murder and second degree murder.
    —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The real difference between first degree murder and second degree murder must be that the accused must have formed a decision to kill the victim to be guilty of first degree murder; for the defendant to be guilty of second degree murder, he must only have acted purposely with the consequence of his purposeful action being the death of the victim. Young v. State, 849 P.2d 754, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 65</cite> (Wyo. 1993), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 81</cite> (Wyo. Apr. 21, 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The differences in the offenses of first degree murder and second degree murder are the element of premeditation and the nature of the criminal intent; first degree murder is a specific intent crime, requiring proof the defendant killed purposely and with premeditation, while second degree murder is a crime of general intent, requiring proof only of acting purposely or voluntarily. Young v. State, 849 P.2d 754, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 65</cite> (Wyo. 1993), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 81</cite> (Wyo. Apr. 21, 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aiding and abetting voluntary manslaughter is lesser included offense of aiding and abetting first degree murder.

        While motive, defined as that which leads or tempts the mind to indulge in a criminal act, is not an element of a crime and proof of it is not essential to sustain a conviction, it does have great probative force in determining guilt, especially in cases which depend on circumstantial evidence.

       <p>
        The element which makes first-degree murder a specific-intent crime, and separates it from the general-intent crime of second-degree murder, is the element of premeditation. Crozier v. State, 723 P.2d 42, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 595</cite> (Wyo. 1986), overruled, Wilkerson v. State, 2014 WY 136, 336 P.3d 1188, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo.

       </p>
       <p>
        First degree murder is a specific intent crime, requiring proof of the element of intent, while second degree murder is a general intent crime, requiring only proof of the element of voluntariness. Premeditation is the specific intent element which distinguishes the two types of murder. Bouwkamp v. State, 833 P.2d 486, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 73</cite> (Wyo. 1992).

        Premeditation, or premeditated malice, should be accorded its ordinary meaning. It is the “thinking over, deliberating upon, weighing in the mind beforehand, resulting in a deliberate intention to kill” which constitutes the killing murder in the first degree. Bouwkamp v. State, 833 P.2d 486, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 73</cite> (Wyo. 1992); Hightower v. State, 901 P.2d 397, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 153</cite> (Wyo. 1995).

        Defendant
   set a fire with an accelerant in the middle of the night directly
   outside of the victim's motel room, from which she had no clear means
   of escape. That combined with evidence that defendant was angry at
   the victim and left town immediately after starting the fire was
   sufficient
   for a reasonable jury to conclude that defendant intended
   to kill
   the victim.

        While it is true that no specific or substantive time period is required for a killing to be “premeditated”, there must be evidence of cool calculation beyond the mere opportunity to deliberate, such as a demonstrated motive, or leaving an altercation to arm oneself. Bouwkamp v. State, 833 P.2d 486, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 73</cite> (Wyo. 1992).

        Where the defendant had the motive to rob the murder victim, his exacting application of repeated, severe blows across the victim's face supported the inference of premeditation. Bouwkamp v. State, 833 P.2d 486, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 73</cite> (Wyo. 1992).

        Supreme Court of Wyoming agrees with the majority of jurisdictions that have addressed the issue and concludes that self-defense is not available to a defendant who kills while engaged in the perpetration of an enumerated felony. The Wyoming legislature has determined that burglary is an offense which carries a significant prospect of violence and that, as such, it is a crime which supports a charge of felony murder when a killing results during the perpetration of the burglary. Allowing a defendant to assert a defense of self-defense to felony murder in instances in which burglary is the underlying felony would be inconsistent with Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a01s6-2-101ol1a" target="_self">6-2-101(a)</a></cite> (2015). Schnitker v. State, 2017 WY 96, 401 P.3d 39, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo.

       <p>
        District court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury that self-defense could have been raised as a defense to the charge of felony murder as self-defense was not available to a defendant who killed while engaged in the perpetration of an enumerated felony. Schnitker v. State, 2017 WY 96, 401 P.3d 39, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether the felony murder doctrine should be further limited in Wyoming and, if so, the appropriate manner of so doing, are matters for the legislature; consequently, the courts have declined to judicially adopt affirmative defenses to felony murder.

        Defendant's conviction for first degree premeditated murder was affirmed, where there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the victim's death was a direct result of bullets defendant discharged into the victim's head, even though neither of the two eyewitnesses testifying at trial stated they actually saw defendant fire the bullets into the victim's head. Both witnesses testified that defendant was the last person to handle the gun prior to the shooting.

        Although the district court erred by instructing the jury as to common law parental duties that were not encompassed within the charged crime of felony murder based on child abuse, the error was harmless because the completed verdict form showed juror unanimity as to defendant's guilt on all of the theories properly alleged; the judgment and sentence had to be amended to reflect the fact that only one charge was brought, that defendant was bound over and arraigned and pled to only one charge, and that he was therefore convicted of only one charge.

       The Wyoming death penalty provisions are not unconstitutional; they do not usurp the supervisory and rule-making power of the supreme court nor expand its jurisdiction in violation of the Wyoming constitution.

       Wyoming's death penalty statute is a constitutional, weighing statute, despite the absence of weighing language, because the Wyoming statute permits the sentencer to consider only those aggravating circumstances enumerated in the statute and does not permit the jury to consider nonstatutory aggravating evidence as aggravating circumstances.

       Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a01s6-2-102" target="_self">6-2-102</a></cite> has eliminated the use of “heinous” and limited those first degree murders deserving the death penalty to those “especially atrocious and cruel, being unnecessarily torturous to the victim.” The language is not unconstitutionally vague. Plainly the second phrase describes the first phrase and is deliberately joined to mean that the murder is “especially atrocious and cruel” because it is “unnecessarily torturous to the victim.” Torture is established as a core element of this particular aggravating factor; strictly construed, the standard set by this aggravating fact will be met by those murders which are accompanied by intentionally inflicted torture, either physical or mental, distinguishable from the usual, the ordinary, the normal sort of homicide in the typical murder case.

       The court improperly applied the aggravating factor of knowingly creating a great risk of death to two or more persons where the State did not present any evidence or suggest that there were other bystanders involved who were threatened with grave harm as defendant shot his intended victims while committing a bar robbery; the statute shows no evidence of a legislative intent that all multiple homicides be subject to the death penalty.

        Because second-degree murder is a general intent crime, a conviction murder must be supported by evidence that the defendant acted with deliberation, but it does not require evidence that he deliberately killed.

       </p>

        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's second-degree murder conviction because it showed that the victim went to the home where defendant lived to buy drugs, that the victim was seen getting into a truck similar to that owned by defendant shortly before her body was discovered, that defendant's semen was found inside the victim's body, and that sexual intercourse occurred shortly before the victim's death; although evidence that defendant had committed the murder was circumstantial, the jury was permitted to make reasonable inferences, and it was logical to infer based upon the evidence presented that defendant killed the victim.

       <p>
        The real difference between first degree murder and second degree murder must be that the accused must have formed a decision to kill the victim to be guilty of first degree murder; for the defendant to be guilty of second degree murder, he must only have acted purposely with the consequence of his purposeful action being the death of the victim.

       </p>
       <p>
        The differences in the offenses of first degree murder and second degree murder are the element of premeditation and the nature of the criminal intent; first degree murder is a specific intent crime, requiring proof the defendant killed purposely and with premeditation, while second degree murder is a crime of general intent, requiring proof only of acting purposely or voluntarily.

        Defendant's attempt to commit second-degree murder was complete when he stabbed victim
   
   with the ice pick; that he stabbed her eight more times leaves little doubt but that he had attempted to kill her. If calling an ambulance saved her life, it also saved defendant from being convicted of the crime of murder and perhaps a more severe sentence, but, with respect to the attempt, that crime was complete, as he had passed beyond the point at which abandonment was legally possible. Accordingly, he was not entitled to an instruction on that defense. Ramirez v. State, 739 P.2d 1214, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 470</cite> (Wyo. 1987).

        Defendant was properly sentenced consecutively for the crimes for which defendant was convicted because there was no double jeopardy violation in that aggravated assault and battery was not the same offense as attempted second-degree murder pursuant to the same-elements test.

        In defendant's attempted second degree murder case, the court's error in failing to properly advise defendant pursuant to Wyo. R. Crim. P. 11 was not harmless because, had the court recited the minimum and maximum penalties at the change of plea hearing, the fact that the State could not recommend a maximum sentence of 20 years would have become obvious. Thus, the court's acceptance of a plea agreement which included an illegal sentence recommendation further undermined the validity of defendant's no contest pleas.

       <p>
        The term “malice,” as used in the law of homicide, has often been defined as the intentional killing of a human being by another, without legal justification or excuse and under circumstances which are insufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter. Nunez v. State, 383 P.2d 726, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 95</cite> (Wyo. 1963).

       <p>
        However, use must be willful, intentional, deliberate or wanton for implication of malice to arise.

       <p>
        Even though the jury instruction provided two correct statements of the law relating the second-degree murder, as it provided the correct definition of maliciously and stated that the act constituting the offense had to be done intentionally but without premeditation, by joining the two statements by the disjunctive “or” the instruction incorrectly gave the jury a choice between two definitions of malice, one of which omitted the necessary concept of reckless indifference. Widdison v. State, 2018 WY 18, 410 P.3d 1205, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of second degree murder, although “malice” is simply the substantive form of the adverb, “maliciously,” it is preferable to define a term in the same form that it is used in the instruction and the statute; however, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it instructed the jury on the definitions of both “malice” and “maliciously” as its definition of “malice” correctly stated the law; and, while the district court incorrectly used the term “malice” - a different form of “maliciously” - substituting a noun for the adverb form of the same root word was not prejudicially confusing or misleading as either form would convey the same underlying meaning.

        District court did not err in instructing the jury, or when it did err, the error was not prejudicial to defendant regarding the court’s refusal to give defendant’s proposed instruction explaining defendant’s right to be armed; regarding the issue of self-defense, including the requirement to retreat or withdraw; regarding the State of Wyoming’s burden of proof as to sudden heat of passion; and regarding the definition of malice.

   and attempted second degree murder—which were both premised
   upon defendant driving a vehicle through a yard and almost striking

        On plain error review, defendant was entitled to reversal of his conviction for attempted second degree murder because the trial court violated Wyo. R. Evid. 303(b) and the Fourteenth Amendment when it failed to instruct the jury that presumptions of malice and specific intent raised from the use of a deadly weapon were not mandatory presumptions.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to prove malice and to convict defendant
   
   of second-degree murder: he walked into his apartment and loaded his rifle with three bullets selected from a box of shells; after coming out of the apartment, he fired one shot in the air; he then pointed the rifle at the victim and fired the second shot about 14 seconds after the first; the wound was horizontal; he then put the third bullet in the chamber and walked to the dying victim and pointed the rifle at his head.

       <p>
        Malice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon in a dangerous and deadly manner if the facts and circumstances so allow. Malice may also be inferred from all the other facts and circumstances. Doe v. State, 569 P.2d 1276, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 290</cite> (Wyo. 1977); Leitel v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to sustain a second degree murder conviction where defendant armed himself and instigated the confrontation with the victim, voiced hostile thoughts about the victim immediately before the slaying, and used a deadly weapon in a deadly manner, from which an inference of malice could be drawn. Butcher v. State, 2005 WY 146, 123 P.3d 543, <cite class="wy_code">2005 Wyo. LEXIS 176</cite> (Wyo. 2005), overruled, Wilkerson v. State, 2014 WY 136, 336 P.3d 1188, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo.

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted second degree murder where the fact of the stabbing, together with testimony from the victim and other witnesses regarding defendant's confrontational behavior made it reasonable to infer that defendant stabbed the victim and did so purposely and with malice.

        Instruction
   that the jury could presume malice from the use of a deadly weapon
   was appropriate because the facts and circumstances allowed an instruction
   that malice could be permissively presumed or inferred from defendant's
   use of a pistol to kill the victim; the instruction properly explained
   that the jury could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon,
   although it was not required to do so. Hereford v. State, 2015 WY 17, 342 P.3d 1201, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

   set
   out in the rule since it was not mandatory and did not shift

        It is difficult to define the line of demarcation between criminal negligence and recklessness in vehicular homicide cases in which the driver causing the accident fell asleep at the wheel, and the distinction is whether the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk, or whether he failed, through negligence, to perceive that risk; what distinguishes the felony from the misdemeanor is the level of awareness of a substantial and unjustifiable risk, and the degree of conscious disregard or perception depends upon the facts of each case.

       <p>
        Where defendant fell asleep at the wheel of his double trailer rig and caused a fatal crash, the jury could have found he consciously disregarded a substantial risk because he knew he was tired but continued to drive, he admitted he consciously put his schedule ahead of tiredness, and the risk of death from a crash involving his vehicle was substantial; the jury could have gone either way, but it was the jury's decision to make, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of aggravated homicide by vehicle.

        In a case in which defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted voluntary manslaughter pursuant to a plea agreement, the district court did not err in sentencing defendant to two consecutive counts of 17 to 20 years of incarceration; while defendant's lack of prior criminal history, reports of his good character, alcohol dependence and abuse at the time of the crimes, and history of mental health issues were valid considerations in determining the reasonableness and proportionality of an appropriate sentence, so, too, were the aggravating factors presented by the prosecutor and the seriousness of defendant's conduct.

       Instruction in defendant's case allocating the burden of proving a sudden heat of passion to the State, which understandably had no inclination or motivation to prove it, and every reason to disprove it, as it negated the element of malice needed to convict defendant of first degree murder, effectively allowed the State to control the jury's consideration of the mitigator that defendant relied upon for a voluntary manslaughter conviction; thus, the error was more than a simple instructional error as it created one of those rare cases in which an instructional error was structural, and defendant's first degree murder conviction was reversed due to the structural error.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict mother for involuntary manslaughter for the death of her premature daughter, finding that the child died of hyperthermia and not Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, because (1) only in the scenario in which the child was wrapped in the red electric blanket was the heating of her body adequately explained; and (2) it would account for the marks on the child's body whether they were caused by thermal blistering or sloughing of skin owing to accelerated decomposition associated with high temperatures.

       Under plain error review, instructions given in a voluntary manslaughter case were sufficient to capture the specific nuances of a unique crime where a victim died after defendant struck him in the face during an argument over drinking; the jury was given an elements instructions, definitions of voluntary and heat of passion, and a lesser-included instruction on criminally negligent homicide.

      <p>
       In a case where defendant was convicted of first degree murder, but sought a conviction for voluntary manslaughter based on the sudden heat of passion mitigator, because there is ample authority that a sudden heat of passion killing not only can be, but often is, intentional, on retrial, it would be improper to instruct or suggest that a killing under a sudden heat of passion could not include a case in which defendant had the subjective intent to kill.

      <p>
       A jury instruction concerning the offense of manslaughter was fundamentally defective and, therefore, plain error, where the instruction was based on the previous version of the manslaughter statute which used the terms “culpable neglect” and “criminal carelessness” instead of the present term “recklessly.” This amounted to an obvious transgression of the requirement that the trial judge must instruct the jury on the necessary elements of the crime charged. Vigil v. State, 859 P.2d 659, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 148</cite> (Wyo. 1993).

       <b>
        Instruction on “recklessly.” —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       An instruction did not clearly and concisely inform the jury that “recklessly” was an element of involuntary manslaughter, in that it did not advise the jury that in order to find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, they had to find that he acted with “conscious disregard.” To act with “conscious disregard” implies intentional acts despite knowledge of the risk, while acting with “wanton disregard” (the language used in the instruction) implies acts done without conscious regard or heedlessly. Therefore, the instruction only created confusion in the minds of the jurors as to what actions constituted the crime in question. Vigil v. State, 859 P.2d 659, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 148</cite> (Wyo. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recklessness, as defined for involuntary manslaughter, involves a gross deviation from reasonableness, not a lack of necessity to threaten deadly force; thus, the giving of instructions that threats with a drawn deadly weapon or pointing a firearm at another amounts to recklessness, unless reasonably necessary for self-defense, was reversible error.

       Evidence that defendant struck a friend in the face with considerable force during an argument over drinking and evidence that the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head was sufficient to support a conviction for voluntary manslaughter under this section.

   death from a subdural hematoma, and he had been upset most of the
   day because of his concern that the victim and his wife were reconciling. Bruce v. State, 2015 WY 46, 346 P.3d 909, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       Where question facing the jury was whether defendant killed his wife's lover in a sudden heat of passion, and thus was guilty of voluntary manslaughter, or whether he acted with malice, and thus was guilty of premeditated murder, evidence of defendant's prior assault on his wife's ex-husband, and his threat against her other boyfriend, was admissible to prove motive and intent as those concepts related to malice.

      <p>
       Evidence was insufficient to convict defendant of aggravated homicide by vehicle as the evidence did not show that she acted recklessly because she never admitted she was fatigued, let alone that she consciously disregarded any fatigue; she told a trooper that she did not think she fell asleep; there was direct evidence that she was not impaired; evidence that she failed to steer and brake both before and after striking the sedan, coupled with her lack of knowledge of what happened might support a reasonable inference she fell asleep, but it did not support the jury’s conclusion that she acted recklessly; and neither trooper testified that defendant ever suggested she was fatigued or not well-rested.

        Distinction between aggravated and misdemeanor vehicular homicide.—

      </p>
      <p>
       It is difficult to define the line of demarcation between criminal negligence and recklessness in vehicular homicide cases in which the driver causing the accident fell asleep at the wheel, and the distinction is whether the defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk, or whether he failed, through negligence, to perceive that risk; what distinguishes the felony from the misdemeanor is the level of awareness of a substantial and unjustifiable risk, and the degree of conscious disregard or perception depends upon the facts of each case.

       Where defendant fell asleep at the wheel of his double trailer rig and caused a fatal crash, the jury could have found he consciously disregarded a substantial risk because he knew he was tired but continued to drive, he admitted he consciously put his schedule ahead of tiredness, and the risk of death from a crash involving his vehicle was substantial; the jury could have gone either way, but it was the jury's decision to make, and the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction of aggravated homicide by vehicle.

       Evidence of cocaine metabolites found in victim driver's urine was relevant on the issue of actual cause of death in a prosecution for aggravated vehicular homicide arising out of an intersection collision.

      </p>
      <p>
       Where cocaine metabolites were found in the victim driver's blood, and the victim was driving very slowly, proceeding into a controlled intersection on a yellow light that turned red and was looking away from the approaching vehicle, the trial court, in a prosecution for aggravated vehicular homicide, should have instructed the jury that the victim's negligence could be considered when determining the defendant's conduct and the proximate cause of the collision at the intersection.

      </p>
      <p>
       In an aggravated vehicular homicide case, the trial court abused its discretion in excluding evidence relevant to defense, where the excluded evidence, which pertained to defendant's claim that the victim caused the accident by grabbing the steering wheel of the car defendant was driving, was crucial to defendant's theory that his conduct was not the proximate cause of the accident and the victim's death.

      <p>
       The term “reckless disregard of the safety of others” of course implies a much greater dereliction in hazarding the safety of others than ordinary negligence. However, it does not require any intent to do harm either generally, or to the victim in particular. What is essential is that it be shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant drove in a manner that he knew, or should have known was highly dangerous to others, and that he did so intentionally, or heedlessly, with a careless indifference to the consequences.

       Evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable inference of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was operating his truck in a reckless manner where the defendant was driving at a minimum speed of 45 miles per hour and perhaps as high as 60 miles per hour during a snow storm, the safe speed for the weather conditions was 20 miles per hour, the defendant appeared unconcerned about being in a collision, the defendant drove his truck completely off the paved portion of the interstate and slammed into a parked car with its hazard lights on, and defendant continued down the interstate one mile until his truck would go no further. Relish v. State, 860 P.2d 455, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 152</cite> (Wyo. 1993). See Bloomquist v. State, 914 P.2d 812, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 55</cite> (Wyo. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for aggravated homicide by vehicle; defendant's girlfriend's father, who was chasing defendant in another car, was not the proximate cause of the death resulting from defendant's accident as there was no evidence the father brandished a weapon or in any other way forced defendant to flee. Orona-Rangal v. State, 2002 WY 134, 53 P.3d 1080, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 146</cite> (Wyo. 2002), limited, Kite v. State, 2018 WY 94, 424 P.3d 255, <cite class="wy_code">2018 Wyo.

      </p>
      <p>
       There was sufficient evidence under either of two theories
   
   to support the verdicts of guilty returned by the jury. The jury clearly could have found criminal negligence because of the defendant's failure to stop his truck at an intersection or, if it concluded that there had been a brake failure, it could have found knowledge that the brakes were not functioning properly and criminal negligence in continuing to operate the truck with defective brakes.

      <p>
       Despite the trial court's comments on the “legislative mandate” regarding drunk drivers who kill, the facts surrounding the sentencing for aggravated homicide by vehicle reflected that probation was given appropriate consideration and, therefore, there was no error in sentencing the defendant to confinement. Volz v. State, 707 P.2d 179, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 581</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

        Sentence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A criminal sentence imposing a term of not less than 18 years nor more than 20 for aggravated vehicular homicide was not an abuse of discretion given the particular set of facts. Smith v. State, 922 P.2d 846, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       The imposition of consecutive sentences of six to ten years's imprisonment for two counts of aggravated vehicular homicide was proper as the maximum punishment was 20 years and the court focused on the willfulness of the defendant's conduct in driving his vehicle while intoxicated. Sampsell v. State, 2001 WY 12, 17 P.3d 724, <cite class="wy_code">2001 Wyo. LEXIS 11</cite> (Wyo. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentence of two to five years for aggravated homicide by vehicle was appropriate
   
   since it was within the statutory guidelines. Volz v. State, 707 P.2d 179, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 581</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant, who was 83 years of age, was convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide, the entry of his second guilty plea acted as a waiver of his right to appeal the district court's rejection of an earlier plea agreement, allowing for a suspended prison sentence, and of his right to appeal the limitation of the reconsideration hearing to 15 minutes. Moreover, despite defendant's age and medical condition, his sentence to the custody of the Wyoming Department of Corrections for incarceration for a period of not less than 36 months and not more than 72 months, based on factors such as deprecating the seriousness of aggravated homicide by vehicle, was not an abuse of discretion.

       Nothing in the plain meaning of the word “remove” or the kidnapping statute itself requires physical contact for purposes of establishing “removal;” the statute also deems a removal unlawful if accomplished without the consent of a parent, which was the State’s theory that was adequately proven, as the child victim was five at the time and his mother testified she did not know defendant and did not give him permission to take the child.

       Kidnapping and first-degree sexual abuse of a minor each require an element the other does not, as the former requires sexual intrusion, whereas the latter does not, and that the kidnapping charge referred to the sexual abuse charge was of no moment, as the jury was not required to find every element of sexual abuse to convict defendant of kidnapping, and the jury had to find only that defendant removed the child victim with the intent to commit sexual abuse. Double jeopardy did not require the sentences to be merged. Winters v. State, 2019 WY 76, 446 P.3d 191, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 77</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

       Where the evidence showed that defendant abducted a victim at gunpoint, handcuffed the victim inside of a car, committed nonconsensual sexual acts upon the victim, and transported the victim without consent, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of kidnapping, first-degree sexual assault, and third-degree sexual assault.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's aggravated burglary and kidnapping convictions because the victim testified that defendant was “jealous,” and if he got into the house, “he was going to be very upset,” and defendant violently broke in through the back door, smashing glass, and breaking parts of the door jamb; he carried a knife. He pursued the victim when she escaped, he forcibly returned her to the house, and held her in her basement bedroom.

      <p>
       Sufficient evidence supported defendant’s kidnapping conviction; defendant moved the child victim from the bowling alley and then across the river, and the two did not simply spontaneously arrive at the river, but defendant lured the child there and then carried him across the river. Defendant gained the child’s trust at the bowling alley, lured him to the river by telling him he would show him his camp, and deliberately carried him across the river to a secluded area to sexually abuse him.

      <p>
       Evidence was
   sufficient to convict defendant of kidnapping because defendant confined
   the victim in her home, forcing her to remain there in several locations
   - the bathroom, the bedroom, and eventually the living room; during
   the entire time, he had his hands around her neck or her body, rendering
   her unable to seek the usual protections of society; defendant ended
   the confinement only when he became aware that the victim had called
   the police; there was no evidence suggesting that the confinement
   would have ended had the victim not been able to contact law enforcement;
   and defendant intended to inflict bodily injury on or to terrorize
   the victim, as he did so by choking, body-slamming and punching her. Dockter v. State, 2017 WY 63, 396 P.3d 405, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 64</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

The trial court properly found the evidence was not relevant, despite defendant's argument that it showed his intent to protect, not harm, the victim; further, other evidence of the victim's self-endangering proclivities was before the jury.

      <p>
       The state had jurisdiction to prosecute a father for interfering with child custody by failing or refusing to return the child to the custodial parent in Wyoming, even though at the time the crime was committed neither the child nor the father ever had been in the state, in view of the fact that the father's extraterritorial acts had an adverse result in Wyoming.

       Evidence was sufficient to prove sexual intrusion on the alleged seven-year-old victim by sexual intercourse because (1) the victim testified that defendant put defendant’s privates to the victim’s private parts; (2) the SANE nurse testified that the victim told the nurse that defendant laid the victim down, spread the victim’s legs apart, and that defendant’s private parts touched the victim’s private parts in and out; and (3) the victim’s parent testified that defendant was then 29 years old.

       Although the district court erred by failing to define substantial step for the jury and by including the concept of attempt in the elements of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor when instructing the jury, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the instructions as defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to object because the evidence against him was overwhelming as defendant’s statements over several weeks confirmed he had the specific intent to inflict sexual intrusion upon the victim and his actions were strongly corroborative of the firmness of his intention to complete the crime of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor.

       District court did not err by denying defendant’s motion to judgment of acquittal because the victim’s testimony alone was sufficient to support the jury’s finding that defendant sexually assaulted the victim as the victim described, and rational jurors could reasonably conclude that defendant touched the victim for sexual arousal or gratification, given that the victim testified that when the two were alone in the bathroom and the victim was only partially clothed, defendant rubbed the victim’s right breast/chest area with her hand and then placed defendant’s penis in the victim’s genitalia repeatedly, and thereafter, defendant told the victim to keep it a secret.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor, his niece, because he was connected with the victim by affinity as defendant was the victim's uncle by marriage, and, thus, he occupied a position of authority in relation to the victim; and because the State was not required to demonstrate that defendant was able to exercise significant influence over the victim as he was tried and convicted based on his position as the victim's relative.

       Victim's testimony that defendant attempted to have sexual intercourse with her by force but could not complete vaginal penetration because she resisted, along with medical evidence of injuries to the inner portions of her genitalia, provided sufficient evidence to convict defendant of first degree sexual assault; sexual intrusion occurred when defendant penetrated the victim's labia or vulva.

Although there was no direct testimony that defendant touched the victim's genitals while lying in bed with him, the fact that defendant frequently would lay with the victim knowing that he would be aroused could have led the jury to reasonably infer that, when defendant did touch the boy's genitals on other occasions, he did so with the intent of becoming sexually aroused.

Moreover, defendant presented no authority suggesting why the prosecutor should have been prohibited from referring to this properly-admitted evidence when questioning the various witnesses.

       Because an ordinary intelligent person applying common sense to subsection (a)(iv) would not have to guess at its meaning to understand that to avoid punishment, one must refrain from performing a sex act with a person who the actor knows, or should have known, is mentally incapable of understanding the nature and possible consequences of sexual activity, subsection (a)(iv) is not unconstitutionally vague.

       First-degree sexual assault is a general intent crime, and therefore, the trial court must only find that the act was done voluntarily before accepting defendant's guilty plea. If the facts and circumstances of the offense presented at the plea hearing can reasonably be construed to be for sexual abuse, that is sufficient although the actor's subjective intent may, according to his statement, have been something else.

       The actor is not to be punished because he has gratified or attempted to gratify his sexual desires but rather because he has violated the person of the victim. Hamill v. State, 602 P.2d 1212, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 483</cite> (Wyo. 1979).

      <p>
       Resistance is not necessary under circumstances where resistance would be futile and would endanger the life of the female, and where she is overcome by superior strength or paralyzed by fear. Gonzales v. State, 516 P.2d 592, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 191</cite> (Wyo. 1973).

       “Lack of consent” is element specified in this section and may exist without resistance, e.g., through fear. Morris v. State, 644 P.2d 170, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 325</cite> (Wyo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Forcible rape can be established without proof of violence to the victim and that the victim need not always resist the assault. The gravamen of sexual assault in the first degree is lack of consent to the sexual penetration or intrusion, which can be shown by resistance. Resistance by a victim is not required, however, when: (1) resistance would be futile; (2) the victim is “overcome by superior strength”; or (3) the victim is “paralyzed by fear.” Seeley v. State, 715 P.2d 232, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 503</cite> (Wyo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence was sufficient to support a conviction although it allegedly failed to establish that the victim earnestly resisted the assault. The evidence proved that the victim was overcome by superior strength and that resistance on her part would have been futile. Sanchez v. State, 751 P.2d 1300, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo.

       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for sexual assault of developmentally disabled victim where he had prior experience with people who had Down's syndrome, he could observe that victim looked different, and he talked to victim. Saiz v. State, 2001 WY 76, 30 P.3d 21, <cite class="wy_code">2001 Wyo. LEXIS 92</cite> (Wyo. 2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's convictions for first-degree sexual assault where physical evidence, including pictures and testimony that the victim suffered injuries from physical restraint and battery and medical tests indicating the presence of fluids consistent with defendant's blood type found on the victim's clothing, corroborated the victim's version of events that her injuries were received when sexually assaulted by defendant.

      <p>
       Because victim's bruising was consistent with a sexual assault, and a reasonable jury could have inferred that the victim likely did not consent to having sex with the defendant because, had she consented, she would have removed her tampon, the jury could also reasonably find evidence sufficient to convict the defendant, notwithstanding defendant's assertion that because he was 69 years old, allegedly infirm, four inches shorter, and 20 pounds lighter than the 27-year-old victim, it would have been impossible to force the victim to have sexual intercourse and that since the victim had received training from a self-defense standpoint as a correction officer, she would have known how to avoid any such advance.

       The manner of committing sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree not only is differentiated under the statutory language, but obviously these offenses can be committed by acts or conduct different from that proscribed by the statute forbidding sexual assault in the first degree. Because of this, every element of the claimed lesser included offenses of sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree was not necessarily encompassed within the commission of the greater offense of sexual assault in the first degree, and the lesser included offense instructions were not required. Also, with respect to the claimed lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third degree, the evidence justified a conclusion of penetration or nothing and an instruction relating to “sexual contact” would not have been appropriate.

       A defendant's conviction under this section for sexual assault was reversed, where, among other evidentiary errors, (1) even though the trial court had ordered that witnesses not be asked to vouch for the credibility of the child who was the alleged victim, the prosecutor continued to do so, despite admonitions and sustained objections; and (2) the improper introduction of a volume of evidence of the defendant's “lifestyle” or character permeated the trial.

A no contact condition was reasonably related to the violent sexual crimes for which he was convicted and for which he was charged, and the provision did not impermissibly encroach on his fundamental right as a parent to raise his children.

      <p>
       Defendant’s conviction for sexual contact with a resident of a correctional facility did not violate her due process rights under either the state or federal constitutions because the statutes at issue clearly proscribed her conduct, the State had an undeniable interest in ensuring the relationship of state prisoners and the state officers who supervised their confinement was not undermined by sexual contact, consensual or otherwise, and, although defendant raised the Wyoming constitutional argument below and on appeal, her argument largely echoed her argument under the federal constitution and she provided no analysis of any of the requisite factors or legal reasons justifying resort to independent state grounds.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's
   plea was entered knowingly and voluntarily because defendant had sufficient
   information to understand the nature of the charge against him; defendant
   was present at the hearing on his motion for a bill of particulars,
   at which the State clarified it would be charging him with sexual
   assault, and at the plea hearing, defendant asserted that he discussed
   his plea with counsel and was satisfied with the advice his was given.

      </p>
      <p>
       District court
   failed to establish a factual basis for the third-degree sexual assault
   charge prior to accepting defendant's guilty plea because none of
   the facts supported the element of causes submission of the victim
   by any means that would prevent resistance by a victim of ordinary
   resolution; defendant provided no facts showing that he took any action
   that would have prevented a victim of ordinary resolution from resisting. Williams v. State, 2015 WY 100, 354 P.3d 954, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 115</cite> (Wyo. 2015), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 134</cite> (Wyo. Aug. 26, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the
   district court failed to establish a factual basis for the third-degree
   sexual assault charge prior to accepting defendant's guilty plea,
   there was no plain error because the record revealed sufficient support
   for the plea, and defendant was not materially prejudiced by the district
   court's failure to establish a sufficient factual basis at the plea
   hearing; there were sufficient facts in the record to support the
   elements of third-degree sexual assault. Williams v. State, 2015 WY 100, 354 P.3d 954, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 115</cite> (Wyo. 2015), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 134</cite> (Wyo. Aug. 26, 2015).

       Defendant could not claim on appeal that the crime of second degree sexual assault by a person in a position of authority did not apply to a psychologist because defendant’s no contest plea waived this non-jurisdictional issue, as (1) defendant could have raised the issue in the trial court in a motion to dismiss or argued the issue to a jury, and (2) neither the underlying legal or factual issues barred the State from charging defendant.

       The incest statute requires that the sexual contact or intrusion be committed upon a relative of the accused.

       For purposes of sentencing incest charges merged into the sexual assault because all sexual assault charges required either sexual intrusion or sexual contact, and so did the incest charges.

       The manner of committing sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree not only is differentiated under the statutory language, but obviously these offenses can be committed by acts or conduct different from that proscribed by the statute forbidding sexual assault in the first degree. Because of this, every element of the claimed lesser included offenses of sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree was not necessarily encompassed within the commission of the greater offense of sexual assault in the first degree, and the lesser included offense instructions were not required. Also, with respect to the claimed lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third degree, the evidence justified a conclusion of penetration or nothing and an instruction relating to “sexual contact” would not have been appropriate.

       Defendant’s conviction for sexual contact with a resident of a correctional facility did not violate her due process rights under either the state or federal constitutions because the statutes at issue clearly proscribed her conduct, the State had an undeniable interest in ensuring the relationship of state prisoners and the state officers who supervised their confinement was not undermined by sexual contact, consensual or otherwise, and, although defendant raised the Wyoming constitutional argument below and on appeal, her argument largely echoed her argument under the federal constitution and she provided no analysis of any of the requisite factors or legal reasons justifying resort to independent state grounds.

       Defendant's conviction of second-degree sexual assault, third degree sexual assault, and indecent liberties with a minor was upheld where the trial court held a hearing to determine the competency of the five-year old child victim to testify as to the sexual assault; no separate taint hearing was required because defendant did not come forward with some evidence that taint was present, and competency inquiry, the five-part test to determine the competency of child witnesses, included the question of pretrial taint.

       District court did not err in ruling that an 8-year-old sexual assault victim was competent to testify at trial against defendant. Although the district court recognized her testimony was not perfect, on the whole, the child seemed to understand her obligation to tell the truth and although she may not have been a particularly effective witness because she occasionally did not follow the line of questioning, she had the mental capacity to receive an accurate impression of the charged events and a memory sufficient to retain an independent recollection of those events.

       Where patients testified that they were victims of a chiropractor who touched their breasts and pubic areas and made inappropriate remarks during chiropractic treatment, the Supreme Court of Wyoming held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for ten counts of third degree sexual assault in violation of this section because he was in a position of authority over his patients. While not engaged in the practice of medicine, chiropractors governed themselves by ethical codes advising practitioners not to take physical advantage of any patient.

      <p>
       It was plain error for the trial judge to instruct the jury that third-degree sexual assault is a lesser included offense of first-degree sexual assault. Third-degree sexual assault cannot be a lesser included offense to first-degree sexual assault because its elements are not contained within the set of elements for first-degree sexual assault. Craney v. State, 798 P.2d 1202, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 121</cite> (Wyo. 1990).

        Double jeopardy.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       After defendant was acquitted of first- and second-degree sexual assault, and a jury hung as to third-degree sexual assault, a retrial on third-degree sexual assault did not violate double jeopardy because a bill of particulars included conduct other than cunnilingus for which defendant was acquitted, which the crime excluded. Cercy v. State, 2019 WY 131, 455 P.3d 678, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 133</cite> (Wyo. 2019).

      <p>
       The manner of committing sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree not only is differentiated under the statutory language, but obviously these offenses can be committed by acts or conduct different from that proscribed by the statute forbidding sexual assault in the first degree. Because of this, every element of the claimed lesser included offenses of sexual assault in the second degree and sexual assault in the third degree was not necessarily encompassed within the commission of the greater offense of sexual assault in the first degree, and the lesser included offense instructions were not required. Also, with respect to the claimed lesser included offense of sexual assault in the third degree, the evidence justified a conclusion of penetration or nothing and an instruction relating to “sexual contact” would not have been appropriate. Seeley v. State, 715 P.2d 232, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 503</cite> (Wyo. 1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although an appellate court did not decide whether sexual battery was a lesser-included offense of first-degree sexual assault and third-degree sexual assault, a trial court did not err by refusing to give a lesser-included offense instruction because the defendant admitted that sexual contact had occurred and the theory of the defense, consent, only allowed a jury to find defendant guilty or not guilty of the greater offense.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-304" target="_self">6-2-304</a></cite> the district court erred when it instructed the jury on a statutory defense to the crime defined in Wyo. Stat.

Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-308ol1a" target="_self">6-2-308(a)</a></cite>
   and applied to third-degree sexual assault; (2) the jury was instructed that the elements of third-degree sexual assault had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, that consent of a victim under the age of 16 was not a defense, and that a reasonable belief that the victim was 16 or older was a defense; (3) while facts concerning consent were presented to the jury by both sides, the case did not turn on that question, but rather, the case turned upon the question of whether defendant reasonably believed that the victim was 16 years old; and (4) a correct instruction that consent was no defense could have been, and should have been, given.

       Defendant was convicted of two counts of third-degree sexual assault under
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-304ol1aii" target="_self">6-2-304(a)(ii)</a></cite> involving his 10-year-old daughter based upon his daughter's testimony that defendant “massaged” her by touching her legs, arms, breasts, buttocks, and genitals; on appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because it failed to establish the necessary element that, in touching his daughter, he acted with the intent of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse as defined in
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-301ol1avi" target="_self">6-2-301(a)(vi)</a></cite>. An oral express of intent was not required; rather, intent of sexual gratification could be inferred from defendant's touching of the victim on more than one occasion and his commission of the acts when alone with the victim.

      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that defendant abducted a victim at gunpoint, handcuffed the victim inside of a car, committed nonconsensual sexual acts upon the victim, and transported the victim without consent, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of kidnapping, first-degree sexual assault, and third-degree sexual assault.

       Defendant's convictions for third-degree sexual assault, in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-304ol1a" target="_self">6-2-304(a)</a></cite>, were supported by the evidence because the victim testified that defendant, a certified nursing assistant, massaged the tip of his penis in a circular motion with his thumb while he was bathing him; defendant also quit wearing gloves and began contacting the victim's penis with his bare hands.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of third degree sexual assault and intentional abuse of a vulnerable adult because his continued contact after the victim said “no” and his grabbing her hand and placing it on his genitals constituted physical force reasonably calculated to cause submission; he knew or reasonably should have known that the victim through a mental deficiency or developmental disability was incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct as several witnesses testified that the victim’s physical characteristics and speech made her disability apparent; and, despite his intoxication, defendant was capable of forming the intent to abuse a vulnerable adult as he appeared coherent and oriented to time and place.

       Court adequately considered and did not err in rejecting the option of placing defendant on probation after his guilty plea to two counts of third-degree sexual assault because, in its written judgment, the court stated that it found that probation was inappropriate, the issue of probation was also brought to the attention of the district court by witnesses who testified on defendant's behalf, and the PSI discussed probation as a sentencing option and provided a detailed probation plan.

       Potential sex offender registrant's duty to register was improperly terminated under a 10-year provision because he pled guilty to fourth degree sexual assault, which was akin to third degree sexual assault, an offense to which a 25-year termination provision applied; moreover, the state did not waive its right to appeal the termination decision by failing to attend two hearings.

      <p>
       Motion to correct illegal sentence under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 35(a) was properly denied because appellant's constitutional claims, including one that this section violated double jeopardy, were res judicata as they had either been decided or should have been raised on a prior direct appeal. The fact that this section was amended in 2007 did not change the nature of appellant's double jeopardy claim, which had been decided against him on direct appeal.

      <p>
       In defendant's sexual assault case, a court's sentence was proper where the sentence imposed was entirely consistent with the crime, its attendant circumstances, and his character. Defendant ignored the position of trust he held with the victim, his developmentally delayed foster daughter, and he subsequently abused that position, and as the victim's foster parent and guardian, defendant did not take any responsibility for his actions and their harmful effects on a particularly vulnerable victim, nor did he express any remorse.

      <p>
       The defendant and his co-defendant were both found guilty of one count of sexual assault in the first degree, but the co-defendant only assaulted the victim once, while the defendant assaulted her twice. The record also demonstrated that it was the defendant who actually applied the significant force in bringing about the sexual assault, so the culpability of the two defendants was different. These factors rationally supported the imposition of a 20 to 25 year sentence, less than half the maximum term of 50 years, for a first conviction of a violent felony, even though the co-defendant received a lesser sentence, and demonstrated that the trial court did not impose a longer sentence on the defendant simply because of his race.

       Prosecutor's misconduct in referring to defendant as a pedophile during rebuttal closing argument in a prosecution charging defendant with third-degree sexual assault, a violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-304" target="_self">6-2-304</a></cite>, was harmless error under Wyo. R. App. P. 9.04 because defendant had admitted to having sexual intercourse with the victim, and given the evidence at trial regarding whether he knew her age at the time, which was the only real issue at trial, it was doubtful that the prosecutor's use of the word “pedophile” affected the outcome of the case.

       This section simply identifies the time limitations beyond which medical evidence from the usual rape victim becomes remote and thus so speculative that it no longer accomplishes the purpose for which it was designed. This doctrine is intended to protect the rape defendant from testimony which is elicited through unreliable medical evidence and it can hardly be said that it is calculated to serve as a bar to the citizen accused from pursuing exonerating evidence which, in turn, insures his receiving such a fair trial as is contemplated by the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

       It was not an abuse of discretion to exclude a victim’s alleged prior false accusation of sexual assault because (1) the limited probative value of the evidence was outweighed by a risk of unfair prejudice, and, (2) due to the victim’s inability to recall the prior accusation, extensive, potentially inadmissible, evidence would have been required to admit the prior accusation.

       On plain error
   review, defendant showed jury instruction errors alleged were clearly
   set forth in the record and transgressed a clear and unequivocal
   rule
   of law by including fondling or touching the victim's vagina
   in the
   definition of sexual intrusion, contrary to the statute,
   but
   defendant
   was entitled to no relief because the instruction
   also
   required finding
   sexual intrusion by inserting a finger in
   the victim's
   vagina, so
   the State had to prove more than the statute
   required,
   giving defendant
   more protection, to prove sexual abuse
   of a minor
   in the first degree. Nunamaker v. State, 2017 WY 100, 401 P.3d 863, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 105</cite> (Wyo. 2017).

       In a case in which a jury convicted defendant of three counts of sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence that defendant was in violation of his parole at the time of the offenses. Testimony concerning defendant's parole status and prohibition of association with minors was relevant to defendant's motive for lying to his parole agent. Vasquez v.

       There was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s convictions for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because his effort to mask his actions by placing a blanket over himself and the girls, his repeated touchings of the girls in virtually identical ways, and his instructions to keep the touchings secret supported a finding of intent of sexual gratification.

       There was sufficient evidence to support defendant’s convictions for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor because the victim’s testimony that defendant touched her “a little over her privates” provided sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier of fact to find that he had engaged in sexual contact with the victim’s intimate parts beyond a reasonable doubt.

       In a case
   where defendant was charged with attempted second degree sexual abuse
   of a minor in Count III of the information, after being questioned
   by the jury regarding what act defendant was accused of attempting
   to commit in Count III, the district court did not err in providing
   a supplemental jury instruction consistent with the information that
   the act alleged in Count III was the attempted touching of the victim's
   vaginal area. Brown v. State, 2015 WY 4, 340 P.3d 1020, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 2</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the district court erred by failing to define substantial step for the jury and by including the concept of attempt in the elements of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor when instructing the jury, counsel was not ineffective in failing to object to the instructions as defendant was not prejudiced by the failure to object because the evidence against him was overwhelming as defendant’s statements over several weeks confirmed he had the specific intent to inflict sexual intrusion upon the victim and his actions were strongly corroborative of the firmness of his intention to complete the crime of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor.

       State did not breach the plea agreement by stating defendant pleaded guilty to three felony counts of sexual abuse of a minor when in fact he pleaded no contest; the statements were harmless, because there was no sentencing agreement and the district court was not misled by the statements. The district court sentenced defendant 10 to 15 years in prison for the second degree offense under this section, suspended for 10 years of supervised probation.

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of second-degree sexual abuse of a child under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-315ol1aii" target="_self">6-2-315(a)(ii)</a></cite> and was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that defendant touched his victim, a seven-year-old boy, with the intent of sexual arousal, gratification, or abuse because the jury heard the testimony of the victim and the victim's mother, who was defendant's former girlfriend, that defendant would spook with the victim while lying with him in bed and the jury also heard the testimony of the investigating detective that defendant admitted to having an erection when he cuddled with the boy. Although there was no direct testimony that defendant touched the victim's genitals while lying in bed with him, the fact that defendant frequently would lay with the victim knowing that he would be aroused could have led the jury to reasonably infer that, when defendant did touch the boy's genitals on other occasions, he did so with the intent of becoming sexually aroused.

      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor, his niece, because he was connected with the victim by affinity as defendant was the victim's uncle by marriage, and, thus, he occupied a position of authority in relation to the victim; and because the State was not required to demonstrate that defendant was able to exercise significant influence over the victim as he was tried and convicted based on his position as the victim's relative. Butler v. State, 2015 WY 119, 358 P.3d 1259, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 136</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Victim's statement that defendant placed her hand on his penis suggested sexual intent, and that inference was enhanced by defendant's effort to mask his actions by placing a blanket over his midsection and the victim's statement that his reaction to the touching was to “just smile,” supporting a conviction for second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. Jones v. State, 2017 WY 44, 393 P.3d 1257, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 44</cite> (Wyo. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree because he sent messages to the victim on a social media website that stated in extremely graphic detail about his desire to have sexual intercourse and oral sex with the victim; and he took a substantial step to complete the crime as the jury could reasonably infer that defendant was driving to the apartments where he and the victim agreed to meet to pick the victim up and inflict sexual intrusion upon her.

       Evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for sexual abuse of a minor in the second degree because defendant's statements, on their own, were insufficient to uphold his convictions for second-degree sexual abuse. There was never an allegation made by the victim or his mother at trial, or to any of the multiple medical care providers or the forensic interviewer, that defendant engaged in sexual contact with the victim.

       Because the words “indecent liberties” have a definite meaning and because a person of ordinary intelligence can weigh his contemplated conduct against a prohibition of taking immodest, immoral or indecent liberties or assault against a child and know whether or not such contemplated conduct is proscribed by it, this section is not unconstitutionally vague.

       The trial court abused its discretion in relying on a presentence investigation report without making a record or a finding as to the reliability of the information and in relying on a purported victim impact statement made by someone other than the victim, and thus the defendant's sentence under this section was reversed and resentencing was ordered.

       There was no abuse of discretion, under the following facts, in sentencing the defendant to consecutive sentences of six to 10 years and eight to 10 years: (1) the victims were not only young but also of limited mentality and (2) the mother of the victims was also “functioning subnormal.” Munden v.

       Although defendant's maximum term of imprisonment for two convictions under this section was 10 years, his original sentence was imprisonment for not less than 18 months or more than 60 months. However, defendant was placed on probation for a period of eight years, but five months after the original sentencing hearing had been held, the district court revoked defendant's probation and reinstated his original sentence. Because neither appellant's period of probation nor his term of incarceration exceeded the maximum term of imprisonment, his sentence was legal. Leyba v.

      <p>
       Sentence of 17 to 25 years in a case where guilty pleas were entered to third-degree sexual assault and one count of immodest, immoral, or indecent acts with a minor was not disproportionate to the crimes where defendant was accused of touching teenage girls inappropriately for his own sexual gratification; moreover, he was acting like a sexual predator when he groomed the girls.

      <p>
       Trial court did not commit plain error by rejecting defendant's
   sentencing recommendation and instead imposing a sentence of 22 to
   24 years in prison after he entered an Alford plea to three counts
   of first degree sexual abuse of a minor and one count of third degree
   sexual abuse of a minor because defendant failed to establish that
   the trial court found a lack of remorse based solely on his silence;
   even though he entered an Alford plea and remained silent as to the
   factual basis for his guilty plea, he did not maintain that silence
   during his sentencing and his statement to the trial court included
   an apology of sorts. The trial court also identified a number of factors
   that it relied on in reaching its sentencing decision, including the
   victim impact statement and the chronic sexual abuse defendant perpetrated
   on his daughter.

       Court rejected defendant's claim that Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.14.html#t14c03a01s14-3-104ol1repealed" target="_blank">14-3-104 (repealed)</a></cite>, the statute under which he was convicted on two alternative theories of soliciting or knowingly encouraging a person under the age of 16 to engage in illicit sexual intrusion, violates due process guaranteed by the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wyo. Const. art. I, § 6 because it is unconstitutionally vague in that it does not define the term “solicit” or provide fair notice of the prohibited conduct. Defendant failed to sufficiently brief the issue by presenting pertinent authority and cogent argument in favor of his position; the term “solicit” is used in numerous Wyoming statutes without being separately defined; and the plain meaning of the term is clear from its dictionary definitions and is routinely used by other jurisdictions.

       Omission of the victims' names from the criminal complaint, the criminal warrant and the information, rendered the documents fatally defective, deprived the lower courts of jurisdiction and warranted reversal of conviction.

       Defendant did not show plain error under W.R.Cr.P. 52(b) based on prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor did not inform the trial court that two counts in the information did not constitute crimes. Although defendant did not, in fact, solicit a “minor” because an undercover agent was posing as the minor, defendant could have been prosecuted for attempted solicitation of a minor under Wyo. Stat.

       Because Wyo. R.

Even if the evidence was 404(b) evidence, however, it was properly admissible to establish defendant's motive for the robbery.

       In a conviction
   for accessory before the fact to aggravated robbery, the district
   court denied defendant his right to due process in not giving a jury
   instruction on duress because defendant testified that a week before
   the robbery, after he told co-defendant he wanted nothing to do with
   him, co-defendant held a gun to his head and told him that he would
   do what co-defendant wanted him to do or co-defendant would harm
   his
   family; after driving to an unknown location in Laramie rather
   than
   to the liquor store as he had said, co-defendant retrieved a
   gun,
   told defendant to follow his lead, and robbed a hotel; and,
   by the
   time the court ruled that it would not give the duress instruction,
   defendant had admitted the elements of the crime. James v. State, 2015 WY 83, 351 P.3d 279, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 95</cite> (Wyo.), op. withdrawn, sub. op., 2015 WY 83, 357 P.3d 101, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 106</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

      <p>
       Battery is
   a lesser included offense of strangulation of a household member because
   (1) the crimes share the same mental element and require bodily injury
   by some type of physical force, and (2) strangulation also requires
   proof that the victim was a household member and the defendant caused
   bodily injury by impeding the victim's normal breathing with the specific
   physical force of pressure to the throat or neck, so the elements
   of the lesser crime (battery) are a subset of the greater crime (strangulation). Nickels v. State, 2015 WY 85, 351 P.3d 288, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 96</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       Expert on battered women's testimony was admissible in trial for battery and kidnapping, where the expert's testimony was an explanation for the victim's irrational behavior in answer to defendant's specific defenses that her behavior proved he had not battered or kidnapped her. Kenyon v. State, 2004 WY 100, 96 P.3d 1016, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 128</cite> (Wyo. 2004), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 149</cite> (Wyo.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's conviction for battery was not subject to reversal based on admission of expert's testimony concerning domestic violence, to the effect that victims were often motivated to shift blame from the abuser to themselves and to recant when the batterer was facing criminal charges, since testimony did not purport to vouch for the credibility of defendant's wife, and did not impugn the character of defendant, and therefore was properly admitted under Wyo. R. Evid. 702..

       Although defendant pleaded guilty and received probation for the first conviction, where the statute under which defendant was convicted exposed him to a maximum incarceration term of six months, and where defendant was not provided counsel for his first conviction, that uncounseled conviction cannot be used to enhance a subsequent charge to a felony.

      <p>
       In a case in which defendant was convicted of unlawfully touching a household member for a third or subsequent time in the past ten years, the trial court, which sentenced defendant to consecutive 2 to 5-year terms of imprisonment, imposed an illegal sentence and thereby committed reversible error. The trial court mistakenly determined that there was an available enhancement under the statute with which defendant was charged.

Further, the penalty portion of the statute set forth a clear and logical progression from a first battery as set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-501ol1d" target="_self">6-2-501(d)</a></cite>, to a second battery as set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-501ol1fi" target="_self">6-2-501(f)(i)</a></cite>, to a third or subsequent battery as set forth in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-501ol1fii" target="_self">6-2-501(f)(ii)</a></cite>, and the lead-in paragraph to Wyo.

       Trial court erred when it banished defendant from the county as part of his sentence for battery against a household member, his third offense felony under Wyo. Stat.

       District court did not commit plain error when it determined that defendant's battery/domestic violence conviction under either prong of Wyoming's battery statute,
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-501ol1b" target="_self">6-2-501(b)</a></cite>, qualified as a violent felony under
   18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e) because defendant's conviction could have been a violent felony if it fell under two scenarios: (1) if it fell under the second prong of Wyoming's battery statute and it met
   18 U.S.C.S. § 924(e)'s first definition, having as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (2) if it fell under either prong of the Wyoming battery statute and it otherwise involved conduct that presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,

      <p>
       Evidence on behalf of the state that the defendant snatched dark eyeglasses from the prosecuting witness and threw them on the ground is sufficient showing that a battery was committed, and it is not necessary to give an instruction on simple assault.

        Instruction regarding “unlawful touching.” —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where the trial judge clearly explained to the jury that “unlawful touching” was an element of the crime of battery and that in the “touching” process the defendant could justifiably go only so far and no further, the instruction was adequate, proper and sufficient to explain what “unlawfully touching” was within the context of the facts of the case and the law of battery. Horn v. State, 554 P.2d 1141, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 214</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not err when it failed to further instruct the jury in light of the jury's question regarding the term “unlawfully” as used in an instruction because, while the jury's question evidenced some initial confusion about the term, the plain language of the instruction clearly indicated that “unlawful” modified “touching.” The court referred the jury back to that proper and unambiguous instruction and the jury undoubtedly noted the plain language of that instruction and realized that it was the touching that had to be unlawful.

      <p>
       In light of the rule that a lesser included offense instruction need be given only when the trial court determines that the evidence before the jury warrants the giving of such an instruction, a proffered instruction relating to assault and battery clearly was inappropriate. The trial theory of the defendant was that he had no contact with the victim, and the testimony of the victim was that of sexual assault. Seeley v.

      <p>
       Defendant charged with aggravated assault and battery was not entitled to jury instruction on lesser-included offenses of simple assault and of battery, since a rational jury could conclude only that defendant was using his vehicle in a manner reasonably capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-509" target="_self">6-2-509</a></cite>, was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction on battery, under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-501ol1b" target="_self">6-2-501(b)</a></cite>, because nothing showed defendant attacked the victim other than by applying pressure to the victim's neck or throat or that the pressure applied caused pain without impeding the victim's breathing, so a jury could not rationally find defendant battered the victim without strangling the victim. Nickels v. State, 2015 WY 85, 351 P.3d 288, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 96</cite> (Wyo. 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court erred in instructing the jury that assault was a lesser included offense of aggravated assault and battery where assault did not require a threat to use a drawn deadly weapon, and aggravated assault and battery did not require an attempt to cause bodily injury to another.

R. Evid. 404(b) because the challenged evidence served as impeachment under Wyo. R. Evid. 607; (3) an officer's rebuttal testimony was permissible under Wyo. R.

       Defendant was not allowed to withdraw his nolo contendere plea to aggravated assault because (1) he originally pled not guilty; (2) a plea withdrawal would prejudice the government, as the crime occurred almost a year and a half earlier; (3) defendant delayed moving to withdraw the plea for nearly two months after entering it; (4) the delay caused by withdrawing the plea would substantially inconvenience the court; (5) nothing showed defense counsel provided ineffective assistance; (6) the plea was knowing and voluntary; and (7) withdrawing the plea would squander judicial resources, as well as the prosecutor's and defense attorney's time.

       Although the district court erred by instructing the jury as to common law parental duties that were not encompassed within the charged crime of felony murder based on child abuse, the error was harmless because the completed verdict form showed juror unanimity as to defendant's guilt on all of the theories properly alleged; the judgment and sentence had to be amended to reflect the fact that only one charge was brought, that defendant was bound over and arraigned and pled to only one charge, and that he was therefore convicted of only one charge.

      <p>
       Evidence was sufficient to support defendants’ convictions for physically abusing the victim because the victim testified that defendant would sometimes use the black belt as punishment if the victim did not complete his chores, the belt would leave bruises on his bottom, back, and legs, and his three siblings testified that both defendants used a backscratcher to beat the victim.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for felony child abuse; defendant used wood to spank the victim, which left abrasions, bruises, and lacerations. Defendant's argument that the injuries were not serious and that he acted reasonably was misplaced; because the State was entitled to all favorable inferences that could have been drawn from the evidence, the jury was free to reject defendant's proffered justifications for the abuse.

       Considering defendants' repeated failure to accept the remedial parenting advice and services of medical and educational professionals, and the evidence indicating their understanding of their children's needs, there was sufficient evidence to show that defendants acted recklessly through their conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk of harm to their children.

      </p>
      <p>
       When defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder on the underlying offense of aggravated child abuse or child abuse, the denial of defendant’s request for lesser-included offense instructions of criminally negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter was appropriate because the State of Wyoming had to prove the elements of either child abuse or aggravated child abuse and that the victim’s death occurred during the perpetration of that crime. Criminally negligent homicide and involuntary manslaughter contained different elements. Hartley v. State, 2020 WY 40, 460 P.3d 716, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 41</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

      <p>
       In a felony
   child abuse case, a district court erred when it failed to instruct
   the jury in the elements instruction of the count relating to the
   victim that physical injury excluded “reasonable corporal
   punishment”;
   the error was plain because the instructions
   were confusing as to
   the burden of proof. However, the State was
   entitled to retry defendant
   because it presented sufficient evidence
   to support a verdict finding
   that the victim's physical injuries
   due to getting hit in the ribs
   and slapped in the face were not the
   result of reasonable corporal
   punishment. Andersen v. State, 2014 WY 88, 330 P.3d 256, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 100</cite> (Wyo. 2014).

       Section <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c06a01s6-6-103" target="_self">6-6-103</a></cite> (threatening telephone calls) is not a lesser-included crime of this section (terrorist threats). For example, if the state proves that a person threatened a violent felony in reckless disregard of the risk of causing an evacuation, they have proved the elements of this section but not the elements of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c06a01s6-6-103" target="_self">6-6-103</a></cite>, because there is no proof that the threat was telephoned. Therefore, the elements of § 6-6-103 are not identical to, nor a subset of, the elements of this section, and § 6-6-103 is not a lesser-included crime. McCone v.

       Instruction which directed jury to consider inconvenience caused by summoning of police and fire agencies did not create a mandatory presumption that summoning of such agencies constituted a “serious public inconvenience”; moreover, state was not required to prove that a serious public inconvenience occurred, but only that defendant made his threats with intent to cause or in reckless disregard of causing one.

        Statute is constitutional. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute is constitutional on its face; the fact that the statute identifies “lewd or obscene statements” in the definition of harass does not make it a content-based regulation on speech rather than a regulation of conduct without a significant impact on protected speech.
   Dugan v. State, 2019 WY 112, 451 P.3d 731, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1298, 206 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1610 (U.S. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute bears all the hallmarks of a statute that criminalizes conduct without reaching a substantial amount of protected speech; it requires proof that the defendant acted with the specific intent to harass the victim, and subsections (a)(ii) and (b) incorporate the concept of repeated communications to the victim by requiring the State to prove the defendant engaged in a “course of conduct.”Dugan v. State, 2019 WY 112.
      </p>
      <p>
       District court’s refusal to require proof that defendant’s statements met the definition of “obscene” under
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c04a03s6-4-301" target="_self">6-4-301</a></cite> did not render
   Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-506" target="_self">6-2-506</a></cite> unconstitutional as applied to him; the punishment of obscenity under laws that regulate pure speech is much different than the punishment of harassing conduct which includes obscene statements.
   Dugan v. State, 2019 WY 112, 451 P.3d 731, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1298, 206 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1610 (U.S. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court correctly rejected defendant’s proposed instruction because it did not state a proper defense to the stalking charge; defendant’s proposed instruction stated the State had to prove his speech fell within one of the listed categories of unprotected speech to convict him of criminal stalking, but the statute complied with the First Amendment because it punished conduct, not a substantial amount of protected speech.
   Dugan v. State, 2019 WY 112, 451 P.3d 731, <cite class="wy_code">2019 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 2019), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 1298, 206 L. Ed. 2d 377, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1610 (U.S. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statute does satisfy the requirement that there be a standard of conduct; the definition in paragraph (a)(i) is an appropriately clear statement of what constitutes a course of conduct. Luplow v. State, 897 P.2d 463, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) of this section, which excludes “otherwise lawful demonstration, assembly or picketing,” substantially disposes of any contention that the statute affects constitutionally protected conduct. Luplow v. State, 897 P.2d 463, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient specificity exists defining the conduct proscribed to meet the test of vagueness. Luplow v. State, 897 P.2d 463, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wyoming stalking statute is not void for vagueness, nor is it subject to constitutional attack as being overbroad. Luplow v. State, 897 P.2d 463, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       The specific provision making stalking a felony if committed in violation of any condition of probation, parole, or bail is not unconstitutionally vague and does not violate the defendant's right to equal protection. Garton v. State, 910 P.2d 1348, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 16</cite> (Wyo. 1996).

       Defendant who was convicted of stalking based on a protective order issued while defendant was in a locked psychiatric ward was not afforded due process because defendant did not have a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

      <p>
       District court properly denied defendant's motions to correct an illegal sentence because there was no increase in punishment and no violation of his double jeopardy protections; all of the fees imposed upon defendant's conviction were mandated by statute, and thus, it was unnecessary for the district court to attach the fees to the stalking charge in the initial sentence.

       Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of third degree sexual assault and intentional abuse of a vulnerable adult because his continued contact after the victim said “no” and his grabbing her hand and placing it on his genitals constituted physical force reasonably calculated to cause submission; he knew or reasonably should have known that the victim through a mental deficiency or developmental disability was incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct as several witnesses testified that the victim’s physical characteristics and speech made her disability apparent; and, despite his intoxication, defendant was capable of forming the intent to abuse a vulnerable adult as he appeared coherent and oriented to time and place.

       In a case in which defendant pled guilty to intentionally exploiting a vulnerable adult, and was ordered to pay restitution, the evidence provided a reasonable basis for calculating the amount of restitution because, given the victim’s impairment, a person had to view defendant’s suggestion that the victim’s generosity was independent of her exploitation with suspicion; defendant made a post-arrest admission to her adult children that she took advantage of her knowledge that the victim would give her anything she asked for, and that she should have stopped before he ran out of money; and the victim did not have the computer equipment or skills to set up online payments to charitable organizations.

       There was sufficient evidence to support the jury’s guilty verdict for strangulation of a household member because in addition to the testimony of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner, an emergency room physician who saw the victim testified as an expert about strangulation and opined that the victim was strangulated; in addition to the doctor’s testimony, the State introduced dozens of photos documenting the victim’s injuries Morones v.

       Evidence established that defendant’s wife experienced an impediment to the normal circulation of her blood causing bodily injury, and defendant’s strangulation conviction was affirmed; doctors testified that the wife had symptoms consistent with strangulation, including the petechiae and subconjunctival hemorrhages in both eyes, and while either symptom alone might not establish strangulation, the wife said defendant had choked her, and when she returned for more treatment two days later, she had severe bruising and pain in her neck.

      </p>
      <p>
       Battery is
   a lesser included offense of strangulation of a household member because
   (1) the crimes share the same mental element and require bodily injury
   by some type of physical force, and (2) strangulation also requires
   proof that the victim was a household member and the defendant caused
   bodily injury by impeding the victim's normal breathing with the specific
   physical force of pressure to the throat or neck, so the elements
   of the lesser crime (battery) are a subset of the greater crime (strangulation). Nickels v. State, 2015 WY 85, 351 P.3d 288, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 96</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       In connection with defendant’s conviction of strangulation of a household member and domestic battery, because victim impact evidence was relevant, defendant failed to establish plain error; the challenged testimony regarding a description of the shelter and apartment where the victim stayed was not likely to arouse the jury’s passions, plus the defense raised the prospect that the availability of free services from the agency provided a motive for the victim to make a false report, which was directly related to the victim’s credibility.

       The use of defensive force whether actual or threatened, is reasonable when it is the defensive force that a reasonable person in like circumstances would judge necessary to prevent an injury or loss, and no more, including deadly force if necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury to the person employing the deadly force or to another person.

       Trial court did not err by dismissing the first-degree murder charge against defendant because an eyewitness stated that defendant stepped back into his home when the victim charged up the steps, another eyewitness stated that the victim sprinted straight for defendant, defendant told the officers he closed the door and the victim opened it and entered his home, and defendant said that the victim rushed him and he shot the victim. Because defendant was not the initial aggressor he did not have a duty to retreat. State v. John, 2020 WY 46, 460 P.3d 1122, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 48</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

       Subsection (f) is a mandatory immunity provision carrying with it a judicial gatekeeping function following the preliminary hearing. The accused must present a prima facie showing that subsection (f) applies; if the accused satisfies this minimal burden, the burden shifts to the State to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that subsection (f) does not apply.
   State v. John, 2020 WY 46, 460 P.3d 1122, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 48</cite> (Wyo. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) immunity claim does not constitute an objection based on defects in the institution of the prosecution, which the accused must raise before trial. The broad language at the beginning of Wyo. R. Crim. P. 12(b), however, permits the court to hear any defense, objection, or request capable of determination without trial; an accused may raise his subsection (f) immunity claim in reliance on that broad language.

       Trial court
   did not abuse its discretion by declining defendant's request to instruct
   the jury on self-defense in a home or habitation where he provided
   no authority interpreting the definition of “habitation”
   to include vehicles and no authority supporting his claim that a vehicle
   may be “adapted” for overnight accommodation simply
   by choosing to sleep in it. 2016 WY 1, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 1</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
       Court erred in refusing defendant’s request to charge defense of another because the evidence was sufficient to support defendant’s reasonable belief that she had to act to defend her friend during the fight; defendant was trapped under the two men, the victim continued yelling that he was going to kill defendant’s friend, and during the fight, the victim kept trying to hit defendant’s friend and defendant held the victim’s arm to keep him from hitting her friend and to try to calm him.

       District court
   properly convicted defendant of first-degree arson because, while
   he claimed that his intoxication excused his actions, he intentionally
   set fire in a store while it was occupied by customers and employees,
   he admitted to police that he started the fire because he was angry
   about the store's customer service, he had to make decisions and take
   actions that required some presence of mind, witnesses who spoke to
   him stated that he spoke clearly before and after he started the fire,
   he told his mother to say he was drunk when he started the fire, and
   the State presented evidence that he was not intoxicated to a level
   that prevented him from knowing what he was doing. Harnden v. State, 2016 WY 92, 378 P.3d 611, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 101</cite> (Wyo. 2016).

       In a prosecution for first-degree arson, where defendant threw his roommate out and threatened to set his mobile home on fire, the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's proposed jury instruction defining the term “maliciously” because to prove arson the State did not have to prove that the malicious act was directed toward another; the fact that defendant might not have felt actual hostility toward his roommate or toward the police did not mean that he was not guilty of arson because defendant's actions placed them all in great danger and his conduct was without legal justification or excuse.

      <p>
       In a trial for injuring or destroying property of another, the only element of the crime in issue was the identity of defendant, and the circumstantial evidence from which identity could be inferred consisted of defendant's prior statement that he was considering slashing the victim's tires and no one would be able to prove it, his continuing attitude of hostility directed toward interfering with adoption proceedings evidencing motive, his phone call that he was going to come and pick up the child on the night in which the damage occurred, testimony that he was in the area on that night until 1:30 in the morning which rebutted a hearsay alibi, the fact that no one else in the vicinity suffered damage at that time, and the failure to deny the conduct when victim asked him about it. When this evidence is examined in the light most favorable to the state, it justifies the inference of identity and the conclusion that the jury properly found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Coleman v. State, 741 P.2d 99, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 489</cite> (Wyo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       State presented sufficient evidence to prove that the damages amounted to $1,000 or more because the victim and a manager from an automobile glass company testified that he paid $1,715 to fix the windows on the truck and the camper shell; defendant was allowed to present evidence suggesting that figure was too high and it was reasonable for the jury to determine that it was impractical, impossible, or unreasonable to replace the broken truck windows with used glass.

       Where defendant and his wife rented a home and garage, where defendant after arguing with his wife drove his pickup truck through the closed garage door and struck his wife's car, which was parked inside the garage, and where defendant did so a second time, this time driving his wife's car through the garage's rear wall, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of felony property destruction under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a02s6-3-201ol1a" target="_self">6-3-201(a)</a></cite> because a person was guilty of property destruction if he knowingly defaced, injured, or destroyed another's property without the owner's consent. That defendant held a possessory interest in the property did not vest with him consent to destroy it; thus, defendant could be found guilty because he knowingly damaged or destroyed rented or leased property without the landlord's consent.

        Prosecutorial misconduct. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's conviction for felony property destruction was inappropriate because the prosecutor misstated the law during closing argument when she told the jury that all the State had to show was that defendant jumped on the car, and that it did not have to show that he intended to damage it; Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a02s6-3-201" target="_self">6-3-201</a></cite> required proof that defendant deliberately damaged the vehicle or intended that result. Considering the evidence that defendant was goofing around was running from a girl before sliding across the roof of the victim's car in the process, there was a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been more favorable to defendant but for the prosecutor's misstatement to the jury.

      <p>
       Upon defendant's plea of no contest to one count of property destruction, the district court sentenced defendant to a suspended term of imprisonment of four to seven years, placed him on four years of supervised probation under specified terms and conditions, and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of $ 8,570.47. When defendant violated the terms of his probation by failing to pay restitution, the district court did not abuse its discretion by revoking his probation and reinstating his original prison sentence; the existence of other alleged violations did not taint the district court's decision.

       Burglary and criminal trespass (now criminal entry) are, by design, separate and distinct violations of the law. The essential difference between the two crimes is the element of specific intent to steal or commit a felony therein found in the burglary section. Mirich v.

        Self-induced intoxication entitles burglary defendant to criminal-entry instruction. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In a burglary prosecution, given the evidence on self-induced intoxication, which could have been considered to determine whether the defendant was capable of forming the specific intent necessary to steal or deprive a person of his property, the defendant was entitled to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of criminal entry, and the court's failure to give it was reversible error. Eatherton v. State, 761 P.2d 91, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 116</cite> (Wyo. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The court was required to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of criminal entry, where the jury could infer from the evidence that the defendant was too intoxicated to form the specific intent requisite for a conviction of the charge of burglary, but still could decide that he had committed the offense of unlawful entry. Keller v. State, 771 P.2d 379, <cite class="wy_code">1989 Wyo. LEXIS 94</cite> (Wyo. 1989).

        Instruction on lesser included offense properly refused. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Where, in a prosecution for burglary, the defendant's offered instruction would have directed the jury to return a verdict of guilty of the lesser included offense of criminal trespass (now criminal entry), even in the face of obviously sufficient evidence of intent to steal, the instruction was properly refused. Mirich v. State, 593 P.2d 590, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 402</cite> (Wyo. 1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       In burglary trial, trial court properly refused to give instructions on the lesser included offense of criminal entry where the defendant's theory of the case was that he never entered the burglarized vehicle at all. Collins v. State, 854 P.2d 688, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 105</cite> (Wyo. 1993), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1993 Wyo. LEXIS 126</cite> (Wyo. July 20, 1993).

       An involuntary bailment was created when the parents took their daughter to live elsewhere but kept her horse, and the parents, as involuntary bailees, had an absolute duty to return the property when the daughter terminated the bailment; consequently, the brand inspector's action in entering the parents' land to retrieve the daughter's horse for transfer to the daughter's agent was consistent with his statutory authority under Wyo.

       Court of appeals affirmed the district court's judgment removing a criminal case the State of Wyoming filed in state court against a federal agent and a contractor who was working for the U.S. Government, which charged them with violating Wyo. Stat.

      In a case in which defendant pleaded no contest to child abuse and unlawful entry into an occupied structure after he entered the home where his estranged wife and teenage son (the victim) were residing and hit the victim with a wooden shovel handle, defendant waived his challenge to the unlawful entry charge when he pleaded no contest. An alleged defect in the information concerning the victim’s age was not jurisdictional because it did not involve the power of the State to bring defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him.

       In a prosecution for burglary based on defendant's entering and driving a vehicle without permission, the trial court erred in refusing to give his proposed instruction regarding the meaning of the word “deprive” in this section, since there was evidence that defendant intended only to make temporary use of the vehicle.

       Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for felony larceny because there was an intent to permanently deprive where defendant kept a vehicle for 3 months, lied about the owner of the truck, and made no effort to return the truck to the owner or advise him of its location. Defendant argued that his actions constituted joyriding or unauthorized use.

        Larceny is committed whenever a person wrongfully takes and carries away the personal goods of another, without any pretense of right, with the felonious intent to deprive the owner of them, or to appropriate them to his, the taker's, own use. Repkie v. State, 583 P.2d 1272, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 231</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        To sustain guilty verdict on charge of larceny by bailee, two elements must be present: An expressed or implied relationship of trust between the parties, and the accused must have converted the goods with an intent to steal. Epperson v. State, 600 P.2d 1051, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 462</cite> (Wyo. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant does not need to personally exercise physical control over property in order to establish that a taking has occurred; rather, a taking may be accomplished by any means. It may be effected through an animate or inanimate agency, and if the taking is procured by an agent, it matters not whether the agent is innocent or guilty; likewise, an asportation may be accomplished by the defendant personally, by mechanical means, or by a human agent. In light of these rules, the majority of courts hold that, when a defendant sells property that he does not own to an innocent purchaser, the purchaser is the defendant's agent for purposes of the caption and asportation requirements, and the purchaser's taking and carrying away is attributable to the defendant.

        Court erred
   by accepting defendant's guilty plea without having a sufficient factual
   basis to establish he committed the charged crime of larceny because
   defendant deposited checks which were not valid and withdrew money;
   although he took money which rightfully belonged to the bank, he did
   so with its permission. Even though the bank's consent and release
   of the money to defendant might have been based upon a false representation,
   i.e., the checks were valid when he knew they were not, no trespassory
   nonconsensual taking occurred.

         Larceny and obtaining property by false pretenses distinguished. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        One test for distinguishing between larceny and obtaining property by false pretenses is to determine whether the offender could confer good title upon another by sale and delivery of the property. If he could not, the offense is larceny. Neel v. State, 454 P.2d 241, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 135</cite> (Wyo. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        In “larceny,” the owner of the property has no intention to part with title therein to the person taking it, although he may intend to part with possession; while, in “false pretenses,” the owner intends to part with both his possession and title, but such are obtained from him by fraud. Neel v. State, 454 P.2d 241, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 135</cite> (Wyo. 1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a person by trick or fraud obtains possession of property intending at the time of obtaining the property to convert it to his own use, and does so convert it, the fraud is the equivalent of a felonious taking and the offense is larceny, for if only the possession of the thing of value is obtained and it is then converted by the accused, the crime involved is larceny and not false pretenses. Neel v. State, 454 P.2d 241, <cite class="wy_code">1969 Wyo. LEXIS 135</cite> (Wyo. 1969); Otte v. State, 563 P.2d 1361, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 255</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

        The defendant's unlawful entry of a dwelling to copy the victim's unlisted phone number, social security number and insurance policy number constituted burglary because such information can be considered property and its taking as larceny under this section. Dreiman v. State, 825 P.2d 758, <cite class="wy_code">1992 Wyo. LEXIS 15</cite> (Wyo. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's taking and copying of victim's keys and calendar was larcenous
   
   and evidence of such an act was sufficient to sustain his burglary conviction even though he had returned the property. Although the owner may retain the original property, there has been nevertheless a deprivation of property when a copy is made and retained by another. Dreiman v.

        Where defendant sold a vehicle belonging to the victim to a third party, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of larceny and specifically to establish the “taking” and “carrying” elements because, at the time the third party bought the vehicle from defendant, the victim was the owner of the car; consequently, the third party's purchase of the vehicle constituted a taking from the victim. With regard to the asportation element, evidence that the third party loaded the vehicle onto a trailer and transported it to his house was sufficient to establish that he carried the property away; both the taking and the carrying by the third party were attributable to defendant.

        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant for felony theft because defendant possessed the requisite intent to deprive where he admitted that he intended to drive a vehicle until it ran out of gas and then abandon it. 2015 WY 86, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 97</cite>.

        In a larceny case, the State met its burden of establishing the “taking and carrying away” element of the crime because unique tire tracks led to the conclusion that a certain truck was used to take and carry away the stolen equipment. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Pena v. State, 2015 WY 149, 361 P.3d 862, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 166</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's forgery and theft convictions where the State presented the merchant copy of the receipts showing the alterations defendant made, the testimony of the customers confirming that their writing on the receipts had been altered, the restaurant's summary of sales showing that defendant was the server and the amount of the credit/debit card tip she was due was the amount inflated by the alteration, and labor reports showing that defendant signed off shortly after generating the report.

        Because defendant's argument was limited to a claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove a taking of the cell phone that he gave the victim's daughter, and not the victim's cell phone, and the information was amended, charging defendant with taking the victim's cell phone, and an instruction consistent with that amendment was given, the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of misdemeanor theft because defendant took the victim's cell phone after she made the 911 call during the course of events that led to his conviction for kidnapping.

        Sufficient evidence supported a conviction for felony larceny because there was an intent to permanently deprive where defendant kept a vehicle for 3 months, lied about the owner of the truck, and made no effort to return the truck to the owner or advise him of its location. Defendant argued that his actions constituted joyriding or unauthorized use.

        Where the state was unable to prove that rolled coins in the defendant's possession actually came from a convenience store larceny, and relied heavily upon the fact that defendant had the opportunity to commit the crime, this and other incriminating evidence did not provide an adequate link between the defendant and the larceny and was insufficient to form a reasonable inference of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

        The evidence was insufficient to form the basis for a reasonable inference of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was a bailee where in all pertinent instances, the “owners” of the property at issue in the case gave “ownership,” not mere possession of the property to the defendant.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a04s6-3-402ol1a" target="_self">6-3-402(a)</a></cite> provided that “a person who steals, takes and carries, leads or drives away property of another with intent to deprive the owner or lawful possessor is guilty of larceny”; thus, “taking” and “carrying” were essential elements of the offense of larceny.

       Plaintiffs
   could not have maintained a Free Speech First Amendment challenge
   because the statutes did not regulate protected First Amendment activity,
   there was no constitutionally protected First Amendment right to enter
   upon the private lands of another for the purposes of collecting data,
   the statutes were not facially overbroad, and the court declined to
   conduct a facial analysis of the statutes' expungement provisions. Western Watersheds Project v. Michael, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1231, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88843 (D. Wyo. 2016), rev'd, 869 F.3d 1189, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17279 (10th Cir. Wyo. 2017).

      <p>
       Statutes passed
   the rational basis test and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection
   Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the statutes were not promulgated
   out of animus toward a particular group, and did not burden a fundamental
   right because the statutes precluded trespassing to collect any resource
   data, regardless of whether that data was favorable or unfavorable
   to the owner, and the statutes rationally related to the interest
   of protecting private property rights. Western Watersheds Project v. Michael, 196 F. Supp. 3d 1231, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 88843 (D. Wyo. 2016), rev'd, 869 F.3d 1189, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 17279 (10th Cir. Wyo. 2017).

       Defendant took steps to obtain a copy of the victim’s notary stamp and ensured that she had a current copy of the stamp when the original stamp expired, and she passed seven of the eight notarized applications as genuine and acted to keep her deception from being revealed; considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, it was sufficient to support a finding of intent to defraud.

       Legislative intent was to create two separate crimes, forgery and check fraud.
   
   The forgery prohibition is against the making of a deceptive document per se, and that of the check fraud is against the making of a document having validity other than the fact that the funds against which it is drawn are “insufficient.” The defendant, who attempted to pass a check which was not genuine (i.e., it was signed by him under a fictitious name and was on a bank in which he did not have an account and in which there was no account under the fictitious name) was properly charged.

      <p>
       There was nothing improper about sustaining convenience store clerk's forgery conviction even though the amended information did not identify the specific transaction constituting the basis of the charge where, although the state could have charged her with 15 counts of forgery, each of which would support a forgery conviction, she was convicted of one count that embraced all 15 acts, and she neither cited authority that this was improper nor contended that she was not aware of the basis of the charge against her or that her ability to defend herself was in any way compromised.

      </p>
      <p>
       The intent to defraud is to be inferred from the deliberate commission of a forgery. Thus, knowingly passing a forged instrument as genuine is conclusive of an intent to defraud. Evidence that the advantage which the instrument, if genuine, would have given has been obtained, or that the injury which such an instrument could inflict has been accomplished, sufficiently shows an intent to defraud.

       The evidence was sufficient for the district court to draw the inference that defendant acted with the requisite specific intent to defraud the victim in cashing the victim's sales tax refund check, where he cashed the check contrary to the victim's specific directions, and kept for himself $250 more than the victim said she was going to give him.

       Convenience store clerk committed forgery when she entered the victim's credit card numbers into a machine and printed out a receipt that purported to be a record of a sale of goods to the victim, where the record conclusively demonstrated the clerk knew the victim had not given his permission for the transaction; the fact that the clerk was not the one who signed the receipt did not alter the fact that it was the clerk who created the document and thereby committed forgery.

      <p>
       Although the State's handwriting expert testified that there were only “indications” that defendant had written the checks, other evidence was offered at trial that was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for check forgery, including that defendant was found in sole possession of the stolen checkbook, that she had a cash register receipt from the store where one of the forged checks was passed, and that she incorrectly spelled the victim's name when renting a room in the same manner in which the victim's name was misspelled on the check passed at the store. McGarvey v. State, 2002 WY 149, 55 P.3d 703, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 164</cite> (Wyo. 2002).

      <p>
       Sufficient evidence was presented from which a jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant forged the signature on the vehicle's title without authority to do so and with intent to defraud where the owner, who was asked to provide title to his automobile as collateral to obtain a loan, testified that he searched his home and could not find the title. Although the defendant helped the owner look for the title and spoke to the bank loan officer, she did not reveal that she previously removed the title from his home, represented the signature on the back as being his and had it notarized without the owner's authority.

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a06s6-3-602" target="_self">6-3-602</a></cite> because his intent to defraud could be inferred from circumstantial evidence that showed he had the opportunity to steal girlfriend's stepfather's credit card; he admitted that he used the card and signed the stepfather's name; and his girlfriend said that he stole it despite her later recantation. The credibility of witnesses is the exclusive province of the trier of fact, and although defendant's testimony admittedly conflicted with that given by the stepfather and his wife, the jury obviously resolved the resulting credibility issues against defendant.

       Trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the forgery charge because the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she acted with the intent to defraud by sending letters written on her employer's stationary to the Wyoming Department of Family Services advising that seven of her patients did not require substance abuse treatment even though she did not treat those patients at her employer's facility but rather treated them on her own time and in her own home. Defendant did not sign the name of “another” to her letters and no person was defrauded because the patients involved were counseled by defendant, that fundamental representation was in all respects true, and the employer could not have signed the letters because it could not qualify for the license to do so.

       Defendant’s forgery conviction under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a06s6-3-602ol1aii" target="_self">6-3-602(a)(ii)</a></cite> was vacated because the plain meaning of the statutory term “transfer,” when interpreting the statute as a whole, meant causing a writing to purport to be the act of another, as interpreting the term to mean conveying from one person, place, or situation to another rendered “uttering,” under Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c03a06s6-3-602ol1aiii" target="_self">6-3-602(a)(iii)</a></cite>, redundant, and the State’s evidence did not show defendant’s “transfer” of a check resulted in the check’s purporting to be the act of another, as nothing showed defendant wrote the check, signed the check, or otherwise caused the check to be false.

       Based on the evidence provided by the State of Wyoming and the irrelevance of defendant’s actions after defendant made an alteration to the bond order form for defendant’s release, it was reasonable for the finder of fact to conclude that defendant had the requisite specific intent to act fraudulently to secure an advantage to which defendant was not entitled when defendant altered the form to change the conditions for defendant’s pretrial release so that defendant could pay a smaller fee to a bail bondsman and gain defendant’s release.

      </p>
      <p>
       Former statute did not, on its face, unconstitutionally discriminate against indigents as a class on the grounds that only indigents cannot pay an insufficient funds check within 10 days of receiving notice of dishonor or nonpayment; thus, section did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., amend. 14. 14. State v. Laude, 654 P.2d 1223, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 415</cite> (Wyo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since a criminal intent to deceitfully issue an insufficient funds check is an essential element of the crime, the statute does not violate art. 1, § 5, Wyo Const., prohibiting imprisonment for debt. State v. Laude, 654 P.2d 1223, <cite class="wy_code">1982 Wyo. LEXIS 415</cite> (Wyo. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative intent was to create two separate crimes, forgery and check fraud.
   
   The forgery prohibition is against the making of a deceptive document per se, and that of the check fraud is against the making of a document having validity other than the fact that the funds against which it is drawn are “insufficient.” The defendant, who attempted to pass a check which was not genuine (i.e., it was signed by him under a fictitious name and was on a bank in which he did not have an account and in which there was no account under the fictitious name) was properly charged. Binger v. State, 712 P.2d 349, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 444</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

       An essential element of check fraud, which state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, is that check must have been knowingly issued, which statute defines as issued “with intent to defraud or deceive.” Cox v.

       Obtaining property was never a necessary element of a violation of former check fraud statute, while the obtaining of property is always a necessary element of the false-pretenses statute. Barker v. State, 599 P.2d 1349, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 451</cite> (Wyo. 1979) (decided under former law).

      <p>
       Both the complaint and information charged check by fraud, the only difference being a variance between some underlying facts, the complaint indicating that the checks relied on were issued on and after a certain date, while the information, together with the bill of particulars, indicated that the checks relied on were issued on and before that same date. There was no fatal variance between the complaint and information. Brown v. State, 703 P.2d 1097, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 519</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

      <p>
       The former notice provision at the end of subsection (a), i.e., “unless the check is paid by the maker within five (5) days of receiving notice,” was minimally complied with under the following circumstances: the bank notified the defendant that her account had been closed because of “excessive overdraft activity,” and demanded payment of a substantial overdraft balance within 10 days, which balance was greater than a recent bad check that, together with other bad checks, totaled more than $500. In any case, the notice provision was a procedural requirement, not an element of the offense. Brown v. State, 703 P.2d 1097, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo.

       Any person with authority to enforce this article or W.S. 11-29-101 through 11-29-115 and who has probable cause to believe there has been a violation of this article may impound any animal treated cruelly. The following shall apply to impounding an animal under this subsection:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t06c03a10s6-3-1010ol1ai">
         If any animal is impounded under this subsection the following shall apply:

          <li id="t06c03a10s6-3-1010ol1aiA">
           Within the earlier of seventy-two (72) hours of impoundment or charges being filed, the circuit court shall hold a hearing to set a bond in an amount the circuit court determines is sufficient to provide for the animal’s reasonable costs of impoundment for at least ninety (90) days including the day on which the animal was impounded. At the request of the owner of the animal, the court may make a determination on the disposition of the animal at a hearing pursuant to this subparagraph;
          </li>
          <li id="t06c03a10s6-3-1010ol1aiB">
           The bond shall be posted by the owner of the animal with the circuit court in the county where the animal was impounded within ten (10) days after the hearing required by this subparagraph.

As used in this section, “dispose” means to place for adoption, sell, destroy or return to the owner. The owner of the animal shall be liable for all costs associated with the final disposition of the animal under this subsection. Posting of a bond shall not prevent the person with authority to enforce this article or W.S. 11-29-101 through 11-29-115 from disposing of the impounded animal before the expiration of the period covered by the bond if during a disposition hearing pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this subsection the court orders the forfeiture of the animal to a person with authority to enforce this article or W.S. 11-29-101 through 11-29-115 or the owner voluntarily forfeits the animal. No animal shall be forfeited pursuant to paragraph (vi) of this subsection without a hearing pursuant to paragraphs (vi) through (viii) of this subsection, regardless of whether a bond is posted, if the animal is connected to the livelihood or ability to make a living of the owner;

If, after the hearing, the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the animal was not subjected to a violation of this article, the animal shall be returned to the owner of the animal and the owner shall not be responsible for any costs of the impoundment incurred after a finding that the animal was not subjected to a violation of this article unless the person later pleads guilty to or is found guilty of a violation of this article.

        Incest does not merge into second-degree sexual assault. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The incest statute requires that the sexual contact or intrusion be committed upon a relative of the accused. This family relationship element prevents the incest conviction from merging into the second-degree sexual assault conviction since a family relationship was not a necessary element for the sexual assault. Owen v. State, 902 P.2d 190, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 154</cite> (Wyo. 1995), overruled in part, Sweets v. State, 2013 WY 98, 307 P.3d 860, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 103</cite> (Wyo. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Admission of testimony regarding defendant's conduct
   
   as described by the victim and her older sister was justified as proof of motive and was sufficiently similar to meet the relevancy requirements of the rules of evidence. Brown v. State, 736 P.2d 1110, <cite class="wy_code">1987 Wyo. LEXIS 447</cite> (Wyo. 1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Consecutive sentences violated double jeopardy provisions against multiple punishments for the same offense,
   
   where the defendant committed two acts of sexual intrusion at the same time and place, and the sentences imposed for those crimes were not required to be merged. Parker v. State, 882 P.2d 1225, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 122</cite> (Wyo. 1994).

       Subdivision (a)(ii) of this section is not unconstitutionally vague because it does not enumerate kinds of prohibited conduct; it is necessarily broad to achieve legislative purpose of protecting children against conduct exposing a minor child's life or health to danger, and is sufficiently definite to give notice concerning criminal conduct prohibited.

       Subdivision (a)(ii) of this section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to mother charged with child endangerment in connection with burn injuries to child, since mother could reasonably understand that delaying eight hours in seeking medical care, or failing to protect child from abusive boyfriend, was prohibited criminal conduct.

        Child abuse as lesser-included offense. —

      <p>
       Trial court was not required to give an instruction that child abuse was a lesser-included offense of second-degree murder or manslaughter if the evidence showed that the accused was either guilty or not guilty of the higher grade of the offense. Under certain circumstances, however, child abuse or some related offense, such as assault and battery, could properly be the subject of a lesser-included-offense instruction. Jones v. State, 580 P.2d 1150, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 212</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

       In a prosecution for second-degree murder, it was not error not to give certain offered instructions on the offense of child abuse where there was no suggestion in the evidence that the cause of death of a child was anything but the burns that she suffered at the residence where she lived with defendant.

       In a case
   involving child endangering/obscene act, there was no error in the
   trial court's refusal to admit a proposed jury instruction defining
   “presence” after it initially ruled that it would;
   the
   trial court had first agreed to give the instruction based on
   a similar
   charge in a companion case that was dismissed because the
   alleged
   victim was an infant. Delivering the proposed instruction
   would not
   have helped the jury better do their job. Dougherty v. State, 2016 WY 62, 373 P.3d 427, <cite class="wy_code">2016 Wyo. LEXIS 70</cite> (Wyo. 2016).

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of endangering his children by knowingly and willfully allowing them to remain in a dwelling where he knew methamphetamine was possessed in violation of Wyo.

   because he admitted that he had found the packet of methamphetamine and placed it in a tobacco can, where it was found by police. The evidence also showed that defendant brought his daughters with him to his roommate's house in August 2005 and that they were still in the home when police officers arrived to execute the search warrant,Butz v.

Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c04a04s6-4-405ol1aiii" target="_self">6-4-405(a)(iii)</a></cite>, evidence established that methamphetamine was stored in the dwelling; although defendant claimed that evidence only established that methamphetamine located in the house was for her personal use and not storage, when defendant tried to hide a bag of methamphetamine in a recliner, she was without question placing the drugs in a location for preservation or later use.

       Sufficient evidence supported defendant's child endangerment conviction for knowingly and willfully permitting a child to enter and remain in a dwelling wherein methamphetamine was stored.

He was sentenced to terms of eighteen to twenty-four months on each of the last two counts, with these two sentences to run concurrently, but consecutive to the sentences on the first two charges; the district court was not required to merge the different crimes for sentencing under the Blockburger test, because the offenses were different as each required proof of an element that the other did not.

       Section was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant where the facts of the case did not demonstrate arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement of the section in that the jury concluded that defendant was a public servant performing a governmental function while another jury might have concluded otherwise.

       Section is not unconstitutionally vague because it adequately specifies the standard of conduct it proscribes; the section clearly specifies that the offense of bribery is committed when a public servant solicits, accepts or agrees to accept pecuniary benefit or personal advantage upon an agreement or understanding that his action as a public servant will be influenced thereby. The standard of conduct proscribed is the agreement or acceptance that the public servant's actions will be influenced by the promises of pecuniary benefit or personal advantage; the definition of public servant contained in the preceding provision provides adequate notice that any person participating in a legally authorized act on behalf of a government is subject to penalty for violating the statute; the statute is not so vague as to specify no standard of conduct at all.

       Defendant was a public servant performing a governmental function at the time he solicited and accepted ‘persuasion money’ from a minor's mother, as required by this section, because defendant, as an employee of the counseling agency, was participating in court-ordered treatment of the minor resulting from his involvement in the juvenile justice system.

      <p>
       In Wyoming, an arrest is effectuated when there is the taking, seizing or detaining of the person of another by touching or putting hands on him, or by any act which indicates an intention to take him into custody and which subjects him to the actual control and will of the person making the arrest, or by the consent of the person to be arrested. Such arrest must also be made under real or pretended legal authority and result in the actual or constructive seizure or detention of the person arrested or in his voluntary submission into custody. A person cannot be said to be under arrest when merely an intention or attempt to take, seize or detain him occurs, resulting in no seizure or control over the person. Phillips v.

       When a probationer spends time at an alcoholism treatment facility as a condition of his probation, he is entitled to receive a credit for that time toward his sentence if a charge of escape from official detention will lie.

       Where defendant was arrested for felony attempted larceny and released from pretrial custody to participate in a residential substance abuse treatment facility, defendant was not in official detention for purpose of this section and was not subject to a charge of escape from official detention; therefore, defendant was not entitled to credit against his prison sentence for that time period.

       Where defendant was arrested for felony attempted larceny and released from pretrial custody to participate in a residential substance abuse treatment facility, defendant was not in official detention for purpose of this section and was not subject to a charge of escape from official detention; therefore, defendant was not entitled to credit against his prison sentence for that time period.

       Evidence supported conviction for escape from official detention when defendant ran from courtroom, accessed stairwell and raced down four flights of steps; fact that defendant was apprehended in a short time did not reduce defendant's actions to attempted escape.

       Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for escape.

       Defendant who was charged with attempting to escape from official detention, conspiring to escape from official detention, and felony murder during an attempt to escape from official detention, which were all based upon this section, was not entitled to a jury instruction defining “escape” and thus appellate counsel was not deficient in failing to raise the issue since nothing about the word “escape” or its usage in the statute suggests the word has a technical legal meaning, and there was nothing about the facts that would have confused the jury as to the word's import.

       Defendant's prior state conviction under this section for taking or passing a controlled substance into a jail qualified as a felony drug offense for purposes of the mandatory life sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C.S. § 841(b)(1)(A); the fact that this section also prohibited passing liquor into a jail did not prevent defendant's conviction for bringing methamphetamine into a jail from being a felony drug offense.

      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of this section
   
   with respect to a judicial proceeding is to keep the process of justice free from the contamination of false testimony. It is for the wrong done to the judicial system and the administration of justice that punishment is provided. Edwards v. State, 577 P.2d 1380, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 290</cite> (Wyo. 1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Charge of perjury requires proof of three elements:
   
   (1) The materiality of the perjured evidence upon the issue in the trial in which it was given; (2) that the defendant testified as alleged; and (3) that his testimony (evidence) was knowingly and corruptly false. Edwards v. State, 577 P.2d 1380, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 290</cite> (Wyo. 1978); Smith v. State, 721 P.2d 1088, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 591</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

       <b>
        “Material” statement defined. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       To be “material,” a statement made must have some weight and reference to the determination of an issue before the court. Although its actual effect has no bearing on materiality, the statement must be one which could influence a tribunal, even if only upon a collateral or circumstantially material point. Edwards v. State, 577 P.2d 1380, <cite class="wy_code">1978 Wyo. LEXIS 290</cite> (Wyo. 1978).

       <b>
        Fear and duress no defense. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant urges that his prior testimony cannot be found willfully and corruptly false since he was testifying out of fear and duress based on threats of physical harm, such compulsion cannot excuse perjury in a court, for, in a courtroom, the witness is surrounded by all the protection a court can muster.

       The potential of post-conviction relief does not justify maintaining the status of a “witness” beyond the affirmation of a conviction on direct appeal; up until that point in finality, however, a person who is a “witness” will remain a “witness,” and the provisions of subsection (a) of this section will protect that person.

       Where a witness, who had been offered full use immunity, was cursorily warned in chambers that he would be found in contempt if he refused to testify the following day, but no attempt was made to fully explain either the nature or the effect of a finding of contempt, and the next day the district court made no attempt to question the witness about his refusal to be sworn or his understanding of the consequences of that refusal and, instead, the court angrily slapped him with a contempt charge and dismissed him from the courtroom, it was held that, at the very least, the district court should have asked witness (whose counsel was not present) if he was attempting to assert his fifth amendment privilege and, if so, first to be sworn and then claim the privilege on the record; because the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the court failed to adequately inform the witness of the nature and effect of a finding of contempt, the contempt judgment could not stand.

       This section (threatening telephone calls) is not a lesser included crime of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-505" target="_self">6-2-505</a></cite> (terrorist threats). For example, if the state proves that a person threatened a violent felony in reckless disregard of the risk of causing an evacuation, they have proved the elements of § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a05s6-2-505" target="_self">6-2-505</a></cite> but not the elements of this section, because there is no proof that the threat was telephoned. Therefore, the elements of this section are not identical to, nor a subset of, the elements of § 6-2-505, and this section is not a lesser included crime. McCone v.

       Although defendant's name remained on the liquor license of a lounge, the undisputed facts demonstrated that the defendants neither owned, controlled, maintained nor leased the lounge at the time plaintiff was injured, and because the defendants had sold the lounge under a contract, they would have had to resort to legal proceedings to assert any significant control over the establishment; therefore, no action in nuisance would lie against the defendants because they had no control over the alleged nuisance.

     <p>
      Whenever a nuisance exists as defined in this article, the county attorney or any citizen of the county may maintain an action in the name of the state of Wyoming upon the relation of the county attorney or citizen, to perpetually enjoin the nuisance, the person maintaining the nuisance, and the owner or agent of the building or ground upon which the nuisance exists. In the action, the court shall, upon the presentation of a petition alleging that the nuisance complained of exists, allow a temporary writ of injunction without bond, if it appears to the satisfaction of the court by evidence in the form of affidavits, depositions, oral testimony or otherwise. Three (3) days notice in writing shall be given the defendant of the application, and, if then continued at his instance, the writ as prayed shall be granted as a matter of course. When an injunction has been granted, it shall be binding on the defendant throughout the judicial district in which it was issued, and any violation of the provisions of injunction shall be a contempt.

The assessment of the tax shall be made by the assessor of the county in which the nuisance exists and shall be made within three (3) months from the date of granting of the permanent injunction. If the assessor fails or neglects to make the assessment, it shall be made by the sheriff of the county and a return of the assessment shall be made to the county treasurer. The tax may be enforced and collected in the manner prescribed for the collection of taxes under the general revenue laws and shall be a perpetual lien upon all property, both personal and real used for the purpose of maintaining the nuisance. The payment of the tax does not relieve the person or building from any other penalties provided by law and when collected shall be applied and distributed in the manner prescribed by law for the application and distribution of monies arising from the collection of fines and penalties in criminal cases.

       Although defendant's name remained on the liquor license of a lounge, the undisputed facts demonstrated that the defendants neither owned, controlled, maintained nor leased the lounge at the time plaintiff was injured, and because the defendants had sold the lounge under a contract, they would have had to resort to legal proceedings to assert any significant control over the establishment; therefore, no action in nuisance would lie against the defendants because they had no control over the alleged nuisance.

      <p>
       “(b) Any skill based amusement game that does not meet the requirements of this section shall be removed from the state by the operator.

      <p>
       “(c) Within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this section a skill based amusement game that meets the requirements of this section shall be approved by the commission to continue operating in the state or it shall be removed from the state by the operator.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(d) Each operator shall provide for a nationally recognized, independent gaming laboratory approved by the commission to directly submit to the commission a general functional evaluation laboratory report regarding the software installed on each skill based amusement game indicating whether the skill based amusement game is in compliance with this section. Any skill based amusement game that does not meet the requirements of this section as indicated by the laboratory report shall immediately be removed from the state by the operator.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(e) Skill based amusement games that meet the requirements of this section shall bear a commission issued decal that identifies the operator of the game. No skill based amusement game shall be operational unless it bears a commission issued decal. The commission shall charge a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) for a decal. Each decal shall include the bucking horse and rider emblem. Fees collected shall be deposited to the commission gaming account, which is hereby created. For the period from the effective date of this section through June 30, 2021, funds within the account are continuously appropriated to the commission to pay for reasonable expenses incurred to administer this section.

       “(j) An establishment shall not locate a skill based amusement game in an area of the establishment into which a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years may enter. An establishment shall conspicuously mark each area of the establishment with a skill based amusement game as an ‘age restricted area.’ The establishment shall not allow a person under the age of twenty-one (21) years to play a skill based amusement game.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(k) An establishment shall pay the commission a fee of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to continue to have skill based amusement games in the establishment until June 30, 2021.

      <p>
       “(ii) Forty-five percent (45%) to the school foundation program account;

Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c08a01s6-8-102" target="_self">6-8-102</a></cite>, defendant failed to provide even one situation where the application of the statute was uncertain, much less that it was vague in all of its applications, as he was required to do.

       A defendant need not know his specific status as a convicted felon when pleading guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm;
   the factual basis provided by defendant and the State adequately supported findings that defendant knowingly possessed a firearm and that he was a convicted felon who had not been pardoned therefore, a sufficient factual basis existed for his plea of guilty.

       Although the defendant's felony conviction was set aside and the accusations or information dismissed pursuant to California's § 1203.4 (completion of probation), that did not preclude its use against the defendant. The grace extended to the defendant by the state of California did not go so far as to extinguish his conviction for all purposes. Since the California felony existed for purposes of this section, there existed no plausible reason for the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea. Reay v.

       A personal firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in Wyoming and that remains exclusively within the borders of Wyoming is not subject to federal law, federal taxation or federal regulation, including registration, under the authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce. It is declared by the Wyoming legislature that those items have not traveled in interstate commerce. This section applies to a firearm, a firearm accessory or ammunition that is manufactured in Wyoming from basic materials and that can be manufactured without the inclusion of any significant parts imported from another state or foreign country. Generic and insignificant parts that have other manufacturing or consumer product applications are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition, and their importation into Wyoming and incorporation into a firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition manufactured in Wyoming does not subject the firearm, firearm accessory or ammunition to federal regulation. It is declared by the Wyoming legislature that basic industrial materials, such as, but not limited to, polymers, unmachined metal, ferrous or nonferrous, bar stock, ingots or forgings and unshaped wood, are not firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition and are not subject to congressional authority to regulate firearms, firearms accessories and ammunition under interstate commerce as if they were actually firearms, firearms accessories or ammunition. The authority of the United States congress to regulate interstate commerce in basic materials does not include authority to regulate firearms, firearm accessories and ammunition made within Wyoming borders from those materials. Firearms accessories that are imported into Wyoming from another state and that are subject to federal regulation as being in interstate commerce do not subject a firearm to federal regulation under interstate commerce because the firearm accessory is attached to or used in conjunction with a firearm in Wyoming.

         The tenth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees to the states and their people all powers not granted to the federal government elsewhere in the constitution and reserves to the state and the people of Wyoming certain powers as they were understood at the time that Wyoming was admitted to statehood in 1890. The guaranty of those powers is a matter of contract between the state and people of Wyoming and the several states comprising the United States as of the time the Act of Admission was agreed upon and adopted by Wyoming and the several states comprising the United States in 1889;

         Article 1, section 24, of the Wyoming constitution secures the right of citizens the right to keep and bear arms and this right shall not be denied.

       The trial court did not err by ruling that cattle guards did not materially increase the burden upon a servient estate and that requiring the gates to be closed would be overly burdensome and would deprive the holders of the essential use of their easement where the court found that when the gates were open, the owner's cattle did not routinely escape over cattle guards; in contrast, when the gates were closed, in order to reach their property, the easement holders were required to stop their vehicle at the first cattle guard and walk across it, open the gate, walk back across the cattle guard, reenter the vehicle, drive across the cattle guard, exit the vehicle again, and close the gate.

       District court had the authority on remand to amend defendant's sentence because the amended sentence was consistent with the district court's original sentence and merely reconfirmed that the statutorily-mandated fees remained part of defendant sentence; the statutory assessments were imposed because defendant had been convicted of a crime, and on remand, he still was convicted of a crime.

       Statutes indicate that the fees are imposed as a result of being convicted in a criminal case, not as part of the sentence for any particular crime; the statutes envision that sentencing courts impose the mandated fees separately as part of the overall sentence, rather than as part of the sentence for an individual charge.

       District court properly denied defendant's motions to correct an illegal sentence because there was no increase in punishment and no violation of his double jeopardy protections; all of the fees imposed upon defendant's conviction were mandated by statute, and thus, it was unnecessary for the district court to attach the fees to the stalking charge in the initial sentence.

       A requirement that defendant serve his term of incarceration concurrent with a sentence for which he was presently incarcerated, as well as consecutive to a probationary period that had yet to begin was improper because it was impossible to meet both those requirements, and because the sentence as pronounced would require the period of incarceration to be interrupted by a period of probation. Thus, the sentence was illegal.

        Being an habitual criminal is not a crime — it is a status. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       To be an habitual criminal under this section simply changes the sentencing process so that the sentence which could be imposed for the crime charged (if less than life imprisonment) becomes enhanced to a mandatory life sentence. Schuler v. State, 668 P.2d 1333, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 359</cite> (Wyo. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Habitual criminal statute does not punish a defendant for his previous offenses but for his persistence in crime; hence, the use of defendant's prior convictions to enhance his aggravated assault convictions did not violate his right against double jeopardy.

        “Violent felony.” —

      </p>
      <p>
       Indecent liberties is not a “violent felony” as that phrase is defined by Wyoming law. Cooley v. State, 885 P.2d 875, <cite class="wy_code">1994 Wyo. LEXIS 159</cite> (Wyo. 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       The initially imposed sentences following the defendant's conviction for child abuse were illegal as a matter of law given that the habitual criminal statute applies only to “violent felonies” and that the statutory definition of violent felonies does not include felony child abuse. Rodgriguez v. State, 917 P.2d 172, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 74</cite> (Wyo. 1996), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1996 Wyo. LEXIS 88</cite> (Wyo. June 11, 1996).

      <p>
       Aggravated robbery is a “violent felony” within the meaning of this section. —
   
   While the legislature, in § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c01a01s6-1-104ol1axii" target="_self">6-1-104(a)(xii)</a></cite>, has defined “violent felony” to include robbery, and while aggravated robbery is not listed separately, it does not logically follow that the legislature would conclude that robbery is a violent felony while aggravated robbery is not. Oakley v. State, 715 P.2d 1374, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 512</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require that a crime be previously committed, only that there is a previous conviction. Green v. State, 784 P.2d 1360, <cite class="wy_code">1989 Wyo. LEXIS 254</cite> (Wyo. 1989).

       <b>
        Sentence enhancement requires separate charges and occurrences. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The ordinary and plain meaning of the terms “separately brought” and “separate occurrences” required for sentence enhancement refers to more than just the conviction. These terms refer as well to charges and occurrences separate from each other. Green v. State, 784 P.2d 1360, <cite class="wy_code">1989 Wyo. LEXIS 254</cite> (Wyo. 1989).

        But statute allows enhancing sentences for multiple convictions arising from same occurrence. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this section is to provide additional punishment for people who have not been deterred by previous penalties, and that purpose applies regardless of whether the habitual criminal commits more than one felony during a single occurrence or more than one felony in separate occurrences; hence, a trial court did not abuse its discretion when it enhanced each sentence for each of defendant's convictions of a violent felony arising out of his attempted escape from police by car and on foot and his shooting at police. Urbigkit v. State, 2003 WY 57, 67 P.3d 1207, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo. LEXIS 70</cite> (Wyo. 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the evidence showed that the defendant subjected the victim to both vaginal and anal sexual penetration, these acts constituted separate, forcible sexual intrusions on the victim and proof of different facts was required to establish the elements of each crime, creating a record showing that the defendant's convictions were for separate and distinct crimes. It was, therefore, appropriate for the district court to consider the defendant's convictions as separate and distinct crimes for the purpose of imposing consecutive life sentences pursuant to the habitual criminal statute. Brown v. State, 2004 WY 119, 99 P.3d 489, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 156</cite> (Wyo. 2004), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 182</cite> (Wyo.

       In a sexual assault case, the defendant, a felony recidivist, was properly sentenced to two consecutive life sentences where defendant subjected the victim to both vaginal and anal sexual penetration, in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t06c02a03s6-2-302" target="_self">6-2-302</a></cite>.Daniel v. State, 2003 WY 132, 78 P.3d 205, <cite class="wy_code">2003 Wyo.

       The fact that a criminal defendant's previous felony convictions in other states may not be felonies in Wyoming is immaterial to the application of this section. Gunderson v.

       District court
   properly sentenced defendant to life in prison because a rational
   trier of fact could have concluded that he committed a felony offense
   in Ohio and that he was the individual who committed first-degree
   sexual assault and third-degree sexual abuse of a minor; the testimony
   of a court clerk from Ohio showed that defendant was convicted of
   a felony in Ohio, and the State proved that defendant committed all
   three crimes being used against him to prove he was a habitual offender. Rogers v. State, 2015 WY 48, 346 P.3d 934, <cite class="wy_code">2015 Wyo. LEXIS 54</cite> (Wyo. 2015).

      <p>
       A defendant mounting a constitutional challenge to an underlying conviction in an habitual offender proceeding must make a prima facie showing that one or more of his underlying convictions was not obtained in accordance with his constitutional rights. Once the defendant makes this showing, the prosecution has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conviction was constitutionally obtained. Johnston v.

      <p>
       A 10-to-20 year sentence for a third felony conviction (armed robbery) is not cruel and unusual punishment, violative of either the eighth amendment to the United States constitution, or art. 1, § 14 of the Wyoming constitution, even though the defendant allegedly deliberately chose to use a nonfunctional gun, unloaded and absent a firing pin, to consciously avoid violence and harm.

       The trial judge imposed a 10-to-20 year sentence for armed robbery under this section with the humane principles of reformation and prevention required by art. I, § 15, Wyo. Const. (humane penal code) foremost in mind. Prior to imposing sentence, the trial judge heard testimony from a psychiatrist regarding the defendant's personality disorder, and reviewed, in the presence of the defendant, counsel and the jury, the defendant's history of drug abuse, his unhappy family history, the culpability of his past crimes, and the fact that he used an unloaded weapon in the aggravated robbery.

      </p>
      <p>
       Previous convictions need not precede commission of offense charged;
   
   rather, the state is only required to allege and prove two prior convictions under the habitual criminal statutes. Wyoming. Waxler v. State, 67 Wyo. 396, 224 P.2d 514, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1950).

        Prior convictions required to be set forth in information.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant's claim that paragraphs in the information which described prior convictions should be deleted from the information is without merit since this section expressly requires the prior convictions to be set forth in the information. This section makes the prior conviction a part of the description and character of the offense intended to be punished. Wyoming. Waxler v. State, 67 Wyo. 396, 224 P.2d 514, <cite class="wy_code">1950 Wyo. LEXIS 19</cite> (Wyo. 1950).

        Proof of prior conviction. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a criminal prosecution wherein the defendant is accused of a prior conviction, two questions of fact are presented. The first is whether the prior judgment has been rendered. The second is whether the person named in the prior judgment is the same person now accused of that prior conviction. Chavez v. State, 604 P.2d 1341, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 505</cite> (Wyo. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 984, 100 S. Ct. 2967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 841, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 1922 (U.S. 1980).

        Sufficient evidence of prior conviction. —

      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the certificates of the conviction of the clerk of a United States district court and the admission of the defendant that he had been arrested for bank robbery, a judgment of conviction in that court has been sufficiently shown. Orcutt v. State, 366 P.2d 690, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 133</cite> (Wyo. 1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       But concordance of names of accused and of person previously convicted is not sufficient
   
   to establish prima facie evidence of identity for the purpose of a habitual criminal charge. Chavez v. State, 604 P.2d 1341, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 505</cite> (Wyo. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 984, 100 S. Ct. 2967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 841, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 1922 (U.S. 1980).

       The admission into evidence of court files and records on the issue of the defendant's habitual criminal status did not violate his constitutional right to confront witnesses against him. Amin v. State, 695 P.2d 1021, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 449</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

        No preliminary hearing on habitual criminal allegations. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       As the habitual criminal statute is a vehicle for enhancing a sentence upon a conviction for crime and is not a separate crime, a defendant is not entitled to a preliminary hearing on habitual criminal allegations. Montez v. State, 670 P.2d 694, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 371</cite> (Wyo. 1983).

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the defendant has timely and adequate notice of an habitual criminal allegation, it is not error to deny his motion to strike the habitual criminal charge from the information on the ground it was not included in the original complaint. Montez v. State, 670 P.2d 694, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 371</cite> (Wyo. 1983).

        No right to jury trial with respect to prior misdemeanor convictions.—
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Wyoming habitual criminal statutes do not by their terms encompass misdemeanor convictions for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. With respect to such sentence enhancement proceedings under the state statute or a similar city ordinance, unless the statutory language so requires, a right to a jury trial with respect to the existence of prior convictions does not exist. Jaramillo v. Green River, 719 P.2d 655, <cite class="wy_code">1986 Wyo. LEXIS 560</cite> (Wyo. 1986).

        Use of prior convictions for impeachment only. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not bar the use of prior felony convictions, when used for impeachment purposes and where the following procedures are employed: the court allows the defendant to be impeached at the trial on the underlying felony by permitting his cross-examination on prior convictions; the court then immediately gives the jury a limiting instruction to the effect that testimony regarding prior convictions is to be considered only for the purpose of impeachment and not as any evidence of guilt; and, at the trial on the defendant's status as an habitual criminal, the state proves the prior convictions independently of the defendant's admissions under cross-examination, so that his prior admissions are not used against him in this phase of the trial. Montez v. State, 670 P.2d 694, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 371</cite> (Wyo. 1983).

       <b>
        Notice required before sentence enhanced for prior drivingwhile intoxicated. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory requirement that the sentence to be imposed for driving while intoxicated be more severe as the number of prior convictions of the defendant increases makes said statute a habitual criminal act. Before the sentence of a defendant can be so enhanced, he must have notice of the fact that such is contemplated; generally, the notice must be contained in the information or charge under which he is prosecuted. State ex rel. Motor Vehicle Div. v. Holtz, 674 P.2d 732, <cite class="wy_code">1983 Wyo. LEXIS 394</cite> (Wyo. 1983).

      <p>
       The provisions of subsection (b) relative to a jury trial should be followed insofar as possible upon remand for further proceedings relative to sentencing on the issue of habitual criminality. Chavez v. State, 604 P.2d 1341, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 505</cite> (Wyo. 1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 984, 100 S. Ct. 2967, 64 L. Ed. 2d 841, 1980 U.S. LEXIS 1922 (U.S. 1980).

       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to have jury panel discharged and new jury impaneled after the judge mistakenly read the habitual criminal charge, which included information regarding his previous felony convictions; a defendant may waive the right to not have a jury be informed of prior convictions for purposes of the habitual criminal statute until the habitual criminal phase of the trial. Kearns v. State, 2002 WY 97, 48 P.3d 1090, <cite class="wy_code">2002 Wyo. LEXIS 103</cite> (Wyo. 2002).

        Consideration of mitigating circumstances not constitutionallyrequired. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no constitutional infirmity in the habitual criminal statutes because of the lack of a procedure, similar to that in the death penalty statutes, for presenting mitigating circumstances. Small v. State, 689 P.2d 420, <cite class="wy_code">1984 Wyo. LEXIS 342</cite> (Wyo. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1224, 105 S. Ct. 1215, 84 L. Ed. 2d 356, 1985 U.S. LEXIS 1062 (U.S. 1985).

       Any sentence other than a sentence specifically designated as a sentence of life imprisonment without parole is subject to commutation by the governor. A person sentenced to life imprisonment for an offense committed after the person reached the age of eighteen (18) years is not eligible for parole unless the governor has commuted the person’s sentence to a term of years. A person sentenced to life imprisonment for an offense committed before the person reached the age of eighteen (18) years shall be eligible for parole after commutation of his sentence to a term of years or after having served twenty-five (25) years of incarceration, except that if the person committed any of the acts specified in W.S. 7-13-402(b) after having reached the age of eighteen (18) years the person shall not be eligible for parole.

      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant’s sentence 12 to 50 years for aggravated robbery was not an unconstitutional de facto life sentence because the age on the date of his earliest possible release was 60, which was younger than the 61-years threshold adopted by the Wyoming Supreme Court. Davis v. State, 2020 WY 122, 472 P.3d 1030, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 141</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

       Defendant’s 1992 sentence, which was imposed when defendant was a juvenile, was not a de facto life sentence entitling him to an individualized sentencing hearing under Miller v. Alabama. Defendant’s sentence would render him eligible for parole after serving a minimum of 43 years, at which point he would be 58-years old. Wiley v. State, 2020 WY 49, 461 P.3d 413, <cite class="wy_code">2020 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 2020).

       District court
   correctly applied the law and did not abuse its discretion in denying
   an inmate's motion for relief because it properly disposed of the
   inmate's civil rights suit; the district court concluded that the
   inmate's life sentence did not fall within the exemption for inmates
   under a death sentence or a sentence of “life without the possibility
   of parole” because it was not designated as a sentence of life
   without parole, which was the type of life sentence addressed in the
   exemption Nicodemus v. Lampert, 2014 WY 135, 336 P.3d 671, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the aggregate sentences imposed on defendant for crimes committed as a juvenile did not deprive the parole board of its statutory authority to consider parole of a juvenile after 25 years, the sentence exceeded the limits imposed by Miller v. Alabama and Bear Cloud v. State. Sam v. State, 2017 WY 98, 401 P.3d 834, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 99</cite> (Wyo. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 1988, 201 L.

      <p>
       Defendant's
   aggregate sentence, which would require defendant to serve at least
   35 years before he became parole eligible, was not a de facto life
   sentence and did not violate the Eighth Amendment because defendant
   would be eligible for parole when he was approximately 50 years old;
   defendant failed to establish that the sentence did not provide him
   a meaningful opportunity for release. Sen v. State, 2017 WY 30, 390 P.3d 769, <cite class="wy_code">2017 Wyo. LEXIS 30</cite> (Wyo.), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 225, 199 L. Ed. 2d 146, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 4668 (U.S. 2017).

      <p>
       With respect to the future dangerousness considerations of sentencing, it is not unconstitutional for a court to tell the jury about the possibility of executive clemency or parole, but the jury should be clearly informed about a defendant's statutory ineligibility for parole.
