      The first 2018 amendment, by ch. 73, § 1, effective July 1, 2018, in (a)(iii), substituted “commissioners or city or town governing body upon request, and advise with a county, city or town with respect to highway and bridge construction” for “commissioners upon request, and advise with boards of county commissioners with respect to highway construction.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The second 2018 amendment, by ch. 73, § 2, effective July 1, 2018, repealed former (a)(iv), which read: “Prepare or approve plans and specifications for all bridges to be constructed by any county, city or town within the state” and former (b), which read: “No contract for the construction of a bridge is valid unless the plans and specifications have been prepared by the director of the department of transportation or the chief engineer or, if prepared by other professional engineers, the bridge designs, plans and specifications have been approved by the director or the chief engineer before the start of construction. The review and approval under this section shall be made without cost to cities, towns and counties. Final payment upon any contract shall not be made until the bridge is inspected and the payment approved by the designer of the bridge and the appropriate governing body.”
     </p>
     <p>
      While neither amendment gave effect to the other, both have been given effect in this section as set out above.

       The board of county commissioners of each county shall establish a separate road construction and maintenance fund solely for the construction and maintenance of county roads, bridges and culverts. Work using funds from the road construction and maintenance fund of a county shall be performed under contract awarded after competitive bidding if the estimated cost of the work exceeds fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). All work shall be performed under the immediate control and supervision of the board of county commissioners or its authorized representative and in accordance with county road standards as established by the Wyoming county road standards committee. The road construction and maintenance fund program is a supplement to federal aid, primary and secondary road programs in each county. The term “construction and maintenance” as used in this section means construction, reconstruction, surveys, mapping, right-of-way costs, bridges, culverts, general road maintenance and fencing. The county shall use existing grades, bridges and other physical items or facilities in order to minimize or avoid more costly relocation.

This money shall be allocated as follows:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t24c02s24-2-110ol1ci">
         To the highway fund, an amount equal to the counties’ contribution for the cost of the university’s technology transfer program under W.S. 21-17-115(a)(ii) or thirty-one thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($31,250.00), whichever is less;

     <p>
      The legislature of the state of Wyoming assents to the provisions of the act of congress approved July 11, 1916, entitled “an act to provide that the United States shall aid the states in the construction of rural post roads, and for other purposes,” together with all acts and legislation, amendatory or supplementary, or which shall grant or authorize aid for the construction, improvement, maintenance or repair of public roads or highways. The transportation commission is authorized to enter into all contracts and agreements with the United States government relating to the construction and maintenance of roads under the provisions of the act or acts of congress to submit the scheme or program or construction or maintenance as may be required by the federal highway administration and to do all other things necessary fully to carry out the cooperation contemplated and provided for by the act or acts, for the construction or improvement of highways under the act, the good faith of the state is pledged to make available funds sufficient to equal the sums apportioned to the state by or under the United States government during each of the years for which federal funds are appropriated by section 3 of the act and to maintain the roads so constructed with the aid of funds appropriated and to make adequate provisions for carrying out maintenance. Cooperative agreements under the provisions of the act shall be entered into with the federal highway administration only by the commission, but may be for the construction or improvement of either a state highway or a county road. If the road to be improved under such cooperative agreement is a state highway, the state’s share of the expense shall be borne entirely by the state; if the highway to be improved or constructed under such cooperative agreement is not a state highway, the state’s share of the cost of the work shall be divided between the state and the county upon such basis as the commission shall determine, and before an agreement is entered into with the federal highway administration the county must furnish the right-of-way and shall have entered into an agreement with the commission whereby it shall agree to pay its share of the cost and to pay the cost of all subsequent maintenance, work which shall be performed by and under the supervision of the director of the department of transportation, and the county also shall pay into the state highway fund its share of the estimated cost of the construction.

      Where a limited liability company (LLC) severed real property in a transaction that included an “access agreement” between the subsequent owners, the access agreement established that parties intended to allow access and resulted in an implied easement; the fact that, following the severance, the State of Wyoming abandoned certain property adjacent to the severed lots did not affect the easement, and whether the LLC had the authority to grant an easement across property owned by Wyoming was irrelevant because the district court found an implied, not an express, easement.

     <p>
      The legislature finds that due to inaccurate and inconsistent records, there exist roads which are seldom used, not maintained and are not identified as or believed by the public to be county roads but are, in fact, county roads. Recognizing the numerous difficulties resulting from the existence of such county roads, the legislature finds it in the best interest of the public to create a procedure to identify county roads, thereby altering and vacating these abandoned or unnecessary county roads without survey.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A board of the county commissioners of any county may on its motion by resolution duly adopted where it deems the public interest so requires and a road-building emergency prevails incite the procedure for the establishment of an industrial road. The course and the point of termination of the road shall be determined by the board of the county commissioners. Before a board of the county commissioners of a county or counties can initiate the road program herein, it must have the cash money available for the project as described. Upon the adoption of such resolution by the board of the county commissioners of one (1) or more counties, it shall immediately notify the transportation commission of Wyoming of its intentions to establish a proposed industrial road.

     <p>
      The highway authority of the state, county, city, town, or village may designate and establish access highways as new and additional facilities or may designate and establish an existing street or highway as included within an access facility. The state or any of its subdivisions shall have authority to provide for the elimination of intersections at grade of access facilities with existing state and county roads, and city and town or village streets, by grade separation or service road, or by closing off such roads and streets at the right-of-way boundary line of such access facility; and after the establishment of any access facility, no highway or street which is not part of said facility shall intersect the same at grade. No city, town, or village street, county or state highway or other public way shall be opened into or connected with any such access facility without the consent and previous approval of the highway authority in the state, county, city, town, or village having jurisdiction over such limited access facility. Such consent and approval shall be given only if the public interest shall be served thereby.

      The supreme court is unable to glean an intention from the language actually used by the legislature that any new highway which diverts traffic from one already existing is to be considered a bypass. Clearmont v. State Highway Comm'n, 357 P.2d 470,

       Legislature did not simply provide that no city or town should be bypassed.
      </b>
      It provided in plain English and language that cannot be misunderstood that an existing highway in a city or town cannot be moved, relocated or changed so as to bypass such city or town without the choice of the people of the town or city. It failed to mention any new highway if the existing highway is let alone; rather, it is a change from the existing highway to which reference is made in the bypass law. Clearmont v.

       Generally.—

     </p>
     <p>
      From the private
      road statute, Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 24-9-101(a) (2015), and its cases interpreting that statute, the
      Supreme Court of Wyoming draws the following framework to determine
      whether a private road applicant has established the necessity of
      a private road: (1) does the private road applicant's property have
      direct access to a public road or a legally enforceable connection
      with or outlet to a public road; (2) does that public road provide
      convenient and reasonable access to the applicant's property? If both
      questions are answered in the affirmative, the private road applicant
      has failed to establish the necessity of the requested private road. Thornock v. Esterholdt, 2016 WY 63, 375 P.3d 750,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       2016 Wyo. LEXIS 71

      <b>
       Reasonable and convenient access. —
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      For purposes
      of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 24-9-101(a) (2015), a road running between the landowners' northern
      parcel and another parcel they owned provided the landowners with
      reasonable and convenient access where the northern parcel adjoined
      and had direct access to the road, the fact that their right to use
      the road was not a legally enforceable right appurtenant to their
      property did not change the adequacy of the access provided, there
      was no evidence that obtaining a commercial permit imposed a substantial
      burden on the landowners or was obviously impractical and unreasonable,
      and the negative effect on their property values of having public
      road access to their property rather than legally enforceable access
      was irrelevant to the question of necessity under the private road
      statute. Thornock v. Esterholdt, 2016 WY 63, 375 P.3d 750,
      <cite class="wy_code">
       2016 Wyo. LEXIS 71
      </cite>
      (Wyo. 2016).
     </p>
     <p>
      Because the district court never decided the question of whether a proposed private road was reasonable or convenient, collateral estoppel and law of the case did not apply; the question of whether the applicants' proposed route was a reasonable one was not previously before the district court because the issues addressed were whether the applicants filed their application in good faith and whether their property was landlocked.

     <p>
      Private road was properly established to provide a landowner with access to their property because the record supported the designation of the route as the most reasonable and convenient route. Furthermore, the district court did not err when it declined to impose proposed use restrictions—to limit use of the road to a single-family dwelling and agricultural purposes and to prohibit the landowner from using it for subdivision—because the evidence supported the court’s finding that the proposed restrictions were inappropriate.

     <p>
      Although a private road was properly established to provide a landowner with access to their property, the district court erred in its award of damages because damages were not calculated in accordance with the statutory requirements. The court on remand was to instruct the viewers and appraisers to determine and separately report the before and after values of each separately owned parcel of affected land and to explain the factors that affected each reported before and after value.

      Private road was properly established to provide a landowner with access to their property because the record supported the designation of the route as the most reasonable and convenient route. Furthermore, the district court did not err when it declined to impose proposed use restrictions—to limit use of the road to a single-family dwelling and agricultural purposes and to prohibit the landowner from using it for subdivision—because the evidence supported the court’s finding that the proposed restrictions were inappropriate.

      Board of county
      commissioners properly established a private road allowing landowners
      to access their landlocked property over a neighboring property that
      belonged to a storm-water collection facility because the board's
      selection of one proposed route over the facility's property was not
      contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as the board reasonably
      determined that the route was the most reasonable, convenient, and
      cost-effective option for both of the parties. Zowada v. Mullinax Concrete Serv. Co., 2014 WY 121, 335 P.3d 455,

      Conclusion of the board of county commissioners that one road was more reasonable and convenient than another road was supported by substantial evidence because the board considered the condition of the roads, the length of time the roads were open, the use of the property through which the roads passed, and which road would cause the least damage to property over that it passed in determining which road was the most reasonable and convenient.

     <p>
      Choice of a route as a private road was not illogical, uneconomic, and unproductive because although the road was difficult to travel, given the alternative, it was logical, economic, and productive; witnesses provided evidence supporting the conclusion that the chosen road was more economic and productive than the alternative road.

      Because the district court never decided the question of whether a proposed private road was reasonable or convenient, collateral estoppel and law of the case did not apply; the question of whether the applicants' proposed route was a reasonable one was not previously before the district court because the issues addressed were whether the applicants filed their application in good faith and whether their property was landlocked.

      The legislature finds and declares that in order to promote the safety, convenience and enjoyment of travel on, and protection of the public investment in highways within this state, and to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty or aesthetic features of the highways and adjacent areas, it shall be the policy of this state that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising in areas adjacent to the right-of-way of the interstate and primary systems within this state shall be regulated in accordance with the terms of this act [§§
