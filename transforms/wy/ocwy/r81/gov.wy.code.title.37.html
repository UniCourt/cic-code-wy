Only those charges which are necessary and reasonable need be paid and if charges not necessary and reasonable are paid under protest, they may be recovered in a court of competent jurisdiction in any action commenced against the public service commission of Wyoming within thirty (30) days after payment under protest and any amount recovered shall be paid out of the public service commission account.

       On or before the first day of July of each year the director of revenue shall, by requiring special reports or otherwise, determine the total aggregate amount of the gross Wyoming intrastate retail revenues of all public utilities, entities utilizing public utility facilities in the state to furnish retail utility commodities or services to the public, and providers of telecommunication services, except motor carriers, and those utilities exempted under W.S. 37-2-108, for the preceding calendar year. The director shall then determine the ratio that one-half (1/2) of the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium is to the total aggregate gross retail Wyoming intrastate operating revenues. The resulting percentage factor shall then be applied to the annual intrastate gross retail operating revenues of each of such persons for the preceding calendar year and the result shall be the assessment of each such person for the ensuing budget fiscal year. However, the assessment rate against the persons for any one (1) year shall not exceed three-thousandths (.003) of the gross Wyoming intrastate retail revenues of the persons unless the assessment of three-thousandths (.003) is insufficient to produce the amount to be collected. If the amount to be collected exceeds the amount produced by the application of the percentage factor to the gross Wyoming intrastate retail revenue of the persons, an additional assessment sufficient to produce the amount to be collected but not to exceed two-thousandths (.002) shall be made against those persons defined as public utilities in W.S. 37-1-101(a)(vi)(C), (D) or (G) but not cooperative utilities that are eligible for exemption and that choose to opt out from retail rate regulation. By the first day of August the director shall assess the persons, and one-half (1/2) of the assessed fees shall be paid to the director by the persons on or before the first day of October and one-half (1/2) of the fees shall be paid to the director by the persons on or before the first day of April in the ensuing year. The director, in computing the percentage upon which fees for the first fiscal year of the ensuing biennium shall be based, shall deduct any unexpended balance in the commission’s account, less an amount equal to the total of all properly authorized outstanding accounts payable, from one-half (1/2) the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium, and the resultant figure shall be used instead of the one-half (1/2) of the total authorized budgeted amount for the biennium, as above provided. Any unexpended balance in the commission’s account shall not lapse at the end of the fiscal period. “Intrastate gross retail operating revenues” as used in this section shall mean intrastate gross revenues derived from the provision of telecommunications, gas, electric, water and pipeline service offered for final consumption and not for resale.

The rates may contain provisions for incentives for improvement of the public utility’s performance or efficiency, lowering of operating costs, control of expenses or improvement and upgrading or modernization of its services or facilities. Any public utility may apply to the commission for its consent to use innovative, incentive or nontraditional rate making methods.

The verification shall be made by said official holding office, at the time of the filing of said report, and, if not made upon the knowledge of the person verifying the same, shall set forth the source of his information and the grounds of his beliefs as to any matters not stated to be verified upon his knowledge. The commission shall prescribe the form of such reports and the character of the information to be contained therein, and may from time to time make such changes and such additions in regard to form and contents thereof as it may deem proper and each year shall furnish a blank form for such annual reports to every such public utility.

This act shall not be construed to require any public utility operating  outside of a city or town to secure a certificate for an extension  into an area within which it has lawfully commenced operation, or  for an extension into territory contiguous to its line or plant for  which no certificate is in force and is not served by a public utility  of like character or for any extension within or to territory already  served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business. If  any public utility, in constructing or extending its line or plant interferes  or is about to interfere with the operation of the line or plant of any  other public utility already authorized or constructed, the commission  on complaint of the public utility claiming to be injuriously affected,  may after hearing make such order and prescribe the terms and conditions  for the location of the lines or plants affected, as to it are just  and reasonable. The power companies may, without the certificate,  increase capacity of existing plants. For purposes of this subsection, “material addition”  shall not include an addition to a plant that is necessary to serve  load growth, provided that the capital investment in the addition  shall not exceed one percent (1%) of the total capital investment  in the plant on which return is earned, that is assigned or allocated  to Wyoming customers, based on the public utility’s most recent  rate case determination.

      <p>
       In requiring in this section a summons to be issued directing an answer to be filed within thirty days after service, the legislature had in mind were particularly cases where the points to be determined by the district court are whether the commission was acting without or in excess of its powers or whether an order was procured by fraud. Where those matters are involved, the petition of appeal might well be in such form as to require an answer to explain or deny the facts pleaded. But where the points raised were whether the order of the commission was in conformity with law and whether the issuable facts found were “supported by substantial evidence,” a petition of appeal was not subject to dismissal on the ground that it could not be answered.

       The supreme court need only examine the district court's order confirming an order of the commission to ascertain whether it was in conformity with law and whether the result reached by the commission was supported by any substantial evidence. On these points the burden rests upon the appellants to show that the order of the district court and that of the commission is erroneous and did not reach a just and reasonable result.

      <p>
       In view of the plenary jurisdiction of district courts, with common-law power to hold inferior tribunals within the scope of their powers, it would seem that an appeal to the district court from the public service commission should be regarded as a proceeding in the course of the common law, and a writ of certiorari is not an appropriate method to review the action of the district court in such a proceeding.

The commission may determine that rates for the same service may vary depending on cost, the competitive marketplace, the need for universally available and affordable service, the need for contribution to the joint and common costs of the public utility, volume and other discounts, and other reasonable business practices.

       Part of the stated purpose of this section is to allow the public to inspect a public utility's filed service rates. By simply adopting landline terminating access charges without a filing under the cellular service, the public would be unable to determine the charges; this is anathema to the language and spirit of the law of this state. The rates, whether adopted from another service or not, must be filed under the pertinent service once they have been set. US West Communications v. Wyoming Pub. Serv.

     <p>
      It shall be the duty of the commissioners of each power district on or before the third Monday in July in each year to prepare an assessment roll of said district which shall contain the name of the owner together with the description of each lot, tract and easement of land within said district and the aggregate assessment of benefits confirmed by the court against the same. Assessments to meet the current expense of a power district for any year shall be proportioned upon the assessed valuation of the several benefited lots, tracts and easements in the district as such valuation was last fixed for assessment purposes by the county assessor and county board of equalization of the county in which the same are situated. The assessment roll shall also show the amount assessed against each lot, tract, and easement of land in the district to meet the principal and interest or the indebtedness of the district for the current year. When such assessment roll is completed it shall be signed by the commissioners of said district and verified by any one of them. The county commissioners of said county upon the receipt of the assessment roll of said district and at the time of making the requisite tax levy for county purposes, shall levy and assess against each lot, tract, and easement of land the respective amounts levied and assessed against the same on said assessment roll. Thereupon the county commissioners shall certify to and deliver said assessment roll to the county assessor of such county and in case the territory embraced in such district is located in two (2) or more counties a copy of the assessment roll as certified to by the county commissioners of the county having jurisdiction of such district shall be delivered to the assessor of each county in which any of the land of the district is located. Upon receipt of the assessment roll the assessors of the counties embracing any of the lands of such district, shall extend upon the tax roll of such county the respective amounts levied and assessed against each lot, tract, and easement of land, and against each corporation as shown by said assessment roll of said district.

      The court, may, upon the petition of the commissioners authorize them to refund any lawful indebtedness of the district now existing or which may hereafter be incurred by taking up and canceling all or any part of its outstanding notes and bonds, as fast as they come due or before, if the holders thereof will surrender the same and issue in lieu thereof new notes or bonds of such district, payable in such longer time as the court shall deem proper, in an amount sufficient to retire notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, together with such an amount as the commissioners of such district may deem necessary to provide for possible future defaults and delinquencies in the payment of assessments, and bearing interest not exceeding seven percent (7%) per annum. For the purpose of providing funds to pay such refunding bonds with interest thereon, the commissioners may levy assessments against the land in such district, but not in excess of the benefits assessed. In the alternative the commissioners may, if they deem it advisable, issue said refunding bonds in an amount sufficient only to retire all notes and bonds of the district then outstanding and the unpaid accrued interest thereon, and delinquencies in the payment of assessments levied, from year to year, assessments against the land in such district for such purposes, but not in excess of the benefits assessed against the same.

      The commissioners of any such power district shall require that the proceeds of the sale of bonds issued under the provisions of this act [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c07a02s37-7-201" target="_self">37-7-201</a></cite> through <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c07a02s37-7-212" target="_self">37-7-212</a></cite>] be deposited in a special account or accounts in a bank or banks which are members of the federal reserve system, and shall require, insofar as practicable, that each such deposit be secured by the United States government securities having an aggregate market value at least equal to the sum at the time on deposit, or, in any event, the proceeds shall be deposited in some bank or other depository, either within or without the state, which will secure such deposit satisfactorily to said governing body. All moneys received from any such bonds shall be used solely for the purchase, construction, improvement, enlargement, extension or repair of the system for which issued, including any engineering, legal and other expenses incident thereto; provided, however, that such moneys may be used also to advance the payment of the interest on such bonds during the first three (3) years following the date of such bonds. Provided, that any unexpended balance of the proceeds of the sale of any such bonds remaining after the completion of the project for which issued shall be paid immediately into the bond and interest redemption fund for such bonds, and the same shall be used only for the payment of the principal of the bonds, and interest for the first three (3) years following the date of the bonds, or, in the alternative, to acquire outstanding bonds of the general issue from which the proceeds were derived, by purchase of such bonds at a price (exclusive of accrued interest) not exceeding the face amount thereof. Any bonds so acquired by purchase shall be cancelled and shall not be reissued.

      Rates for services furnished by any such system shall be fixed precedent to the issuance of the bonds. Such rates shall be sufficient to provide for the payment of the interest upon and the principal of all such bonds as and when the same become due and payable, to create a bond and interest redemption fund therefor, to provide for the payment of the expenses of administration and operation and such expenses for maintenance of the system necessary to preserve the same in good repair and working order, to build up a reserve for depreciation of the existing system, and to build up a reserve for improvements, betterments and extensions to the existing system other than those necessary to maintain the same in good repair and working order as hereinbefore in this section provided. Such rates shall be fixed and revised from time to time so as to produce these amounts, and the court in its order authorizing the issuance of said revenue bonds shall empower and direct the commissioners of such power district to agree in and by the terms of said revenue bonds, and on the face of each bond at all times to maintain such rates for services furnished by such system as shall be sufficient to provide for the foregoing.

       Conceding the injury hazard to livestock is as great or even greater upon public highways than it is upon railroad private rights-of-way, and that the nature of the peril to livestock is identical on both ways, if there is a material and sufficient area of difference between the ownership and control of the ways used, and if there is a difference in the exclusive character of the use by the railroads of their own rights-of-way as measured against the use of the public highways by motor carriers in common with various other types of vehicular use, then the basis for separate classification would seem to exist and the legislature may impose duties and liabilities upon one class, and fail to impose corresponding duties and liabilities upon the other class, without being in violation of constitutional preclusions of discrimination, inequality, or absence of due process.

      Whenever any railroad company shall contract with any person, persons or corporation for the construction of its railroad or any part thereof, the company shall take from the person, persons, or corporation with whom a contract is made, a good and sufficient bond, in some guarantee or surety company authorized to do business in this state, conditioned that the contractor or contractors shall pay or cause to be paid all laborers, mechanics, materialmen, ranchmen, farmers, merchants, and other persons who supply the contractor or contractors, or any of his or their subcontractors, with labor, work, material, ranch or farm products, provisions, goods or supplies of any kind, all just debts incurred therefor in carrying on the work, which bond shall be filed by the company in the office of the county clerk in the county where the principal work of the contractor shall be carried on; and if any railroad company shall fail to take a bond, the railroad company shall be liable to the persons herein mentioned to the full extent of all debts so contracted by the contractor, or contractors, or any of his or their subcontractors. Any contractor or contractors may take a similar bond from each of his or their subcontractors to secure the payment of all debts of the kind above mentioned, incurred by him, and file the same as above provided. All persons mentioned in this section to whom any debt of the kind above mentioned shall be due from any contractor or subcontractor shall severally have a right of action upon any bond covering the debt taken as herein provided for the recovery of the full amount of the debt, and a certified copy of the bond shall be received as evidence in any action; provided, however, that in order that the right of action upon the bonds may exist, the person or parties herein granted the right shall comply with either of the following conditions, to-wit: First, an action in a court of competent jurisdiction, in the county where the bond is filed shall be commenced within ninety (90) days after the last item of indebtedness shall have accrued; or second, an itemized statement of the indebtedness duly verified shall within ninety (90) days after the last item of the indebtedness shall have accrued be filed in the office of the county clerk of the proper county; and an action shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction of the county within three (3) months after the filing of the statement. In case an action is commenced upon the bond of a contractor, the contractor may give notice thereof to the subcontractor liable for the claim, and in a case the result of the action shall be binding upon the subcontractor, and his sureties, and in any case when a contractor has paid a claim for which a subcontractor is liable, the contractor shall bring action against the subcontractor and his sureties within sixty (60) days after the payment of the claim.

      <p>
       If the telephone and the appurtenances were property “belonging to” the defendant, then they could not be property “belonging to another” for purposes of applying this section. Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear language of this section would indicate that if the property can be said to have belonged to defendant, he cannot be convicted of a violation of the section. Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       In order to make out a violation of this section, it is incumbent upon the state to prove that the defendant had no interest whatsoever in the telephone equipment which would permit it to be described as “belonging to” the defendant. Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

        “Belong” may mean less than absolute title. —

      <p>
       The word “belong” is said to have 2 general meanings: (1) ownership; and (2) less than ownership, i.e., less than an unqualified and absolute title, such as the absolute right of user. Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

        Right of user makes property belong to defendant. —

      </p>
      <p>
       There is inherent ambiguity in the words, “belonging to,” and these words, therefore, are to be given the meaning most favorable to the defendant. The most favorable meaning to him is that the words “belonging to” mean something less than an unqualified and absolute title or ownership such as “the absolute right of user.” Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

        Interest of subscriber. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Until he orders the telephone disconnected, a subscriber has an interest which permits the telephone to be described as belonging to him. That interest may be affected by his demand upon the telephone company that it be disconnected, but until that demand is compiled with, he, at the very least, is an involuntary bailee. In the role of an involuntary bailee he still has a right to possess the property as against everyone except the telephone company, its owner. Horn v. State, 556 P.2d 925, <cite class="wy_code">1976 Wyo. LEXIS 228</cite> (Wyo. 1976).

       A private telephone and telephone equipment on private property belongs to the owner

       Telephones customarily are relied upon for all sorts of communicative uses including those made necessary because of emergencies. To permit strangers to interrupt telephone service could create grave dangers in many instances. On the other hand, if an individual chooses, for whatever reason, to interrupt his own telephone service, that act should not necessarily invoke the same criminal sanction, and it does not. Horn v.

     <p>
      Notice of a public hearing on the proposed assessment resolution shall be given. At least twenty (20) days before the date fixed for the hearing, the notice shall be published one (1) time in a newspaper in which the first notice of hearing was published. Notice shall also be mailed to each owner of real property whose property will be assessed for part of the cost of the improvement at the last known address of the owner as shown on the last completed real property assessment rolls of the county wherein the affected property is located. In addition, a copy of the notice shall be addressed and mailed to “owner” at the street number of each piece of property affected by the assessment. Each notice shall state that at the specified time and place the governing body will hold a hearing upon the proposed assessments and that the owner of any property to be assessed pursuant to the resolution will be heard on the question of whether his property will be benefited by the proposed improvement to the amount of the proposed assessment against his property and whether the amount assessed against his property constitutes more than his proper proportional share of the total cost of the improvement. The notice shall further state that the owner or owners of any property assessed must file a written objection pursuant to section 37-303 [§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t37c13s37-13-131" target="_self">37-13-131</a></cite>] of the statutes if the owner or owners wish to do the trenching and backfilling on their own property outside of utility easements and thereby not be obligated to pay the public utility therefor, if such is permitted by the district and public utility tariff. The notice shall further state where a copy of the proposed resolution levying the assessments against all real property in the district is on file for public inspection, and that subject to such changes and corrections as may be made by the governing body, it is proposed to adopt the resolution at the conclusion of the hearing. The published notice shall describe the boundaries or area of the district with sufficient particularity to permit each owner of real property therein to ascertain that his property lies in the district. The mailed notice may refer to the district by name and date of creation and shall state the amount of the assessment proposed to be levied against the real property of the person to whom the notice is mailed. In the absence of fraud, the failure to mail any notice does not invalidate any assessment or any proceeding under this chapter.

In addition, the person must pay the additional amount of interest as in the opinion of the governing body is necessary to assure the availability of money fully sufficient to pay interest on the bonds as interest becomes due, and any redemption premiums which may become payable on the bonds in order to retire, in advance of maturity, bonds in a sufficient amount to utilize the assessments thus paid in advance. If no bonds have been issued then all unpaid installments of assessments levied against any piece of property may be paid in their entirety prior to the date upon which they become due by paying the principal amount due and the interest accrued thereon to the date of payment.

      After the expiration of thirty (30) days from the date of the adoption of the resolution levying the assessments, the governing body may issue negotiable interest-bearing bonds in a principal amount not exceeding the unpaid balance of the assessments levied. The bonds shall bear interest payable semiannually or annually and shall mature serially over a period not exceeding twenty (20) years, but in no event shall the bonds extend over a longer period of time than the period of time over which the installments of special assessments are due and payable and ninety (90) days thereafter. The bonds shall be of a form and denomination and shall be payable in principal and interest at times and places and shall be sold, authorized and issued in a manner, as the governing body may determine. The bonds shall be dated no earlier than the date on which the special assessment shall begin to bear interest and shall be secured by and payable from the irrevocable pledge of the funds derived from the levy and collection of the special assessments in anticipation of the collection of which they are issued. Any premium received on the sale of the bonds shall be placed in the fund for the payment of principal and interest on the bonds. The bonds shall be callable for redemption from the proceeds of the sale of property sold for the nonpayment of special assessments but not otherwise unless the bonds on the face thereof provide for redemption prior to maturity. The governing body may provide that the bonds shall be redeemable on interest payment date or dates prior to maturity pursuant to notice and at premiums as it deems advisable. The bonds shall be signed by a member of the governing body designated by the governing body and shall be countersigned by the city recorder or the clerk of the board of the town trustees or the clerk of the board of the county commissioners, whichever is applicable, and one (1) of the signatures may be a facsimile signature. Interest may be evidenced by interest coupons attached to the bonds and signed by a facsimile signature of one (1) of the individuals who signed the bond.

Any charge related to mobile telecommunications service shall only apply if the customer’s place of primary use is in this state as provided by the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, 4 U.S.C. §§ 116 to 126.

The commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall determine a reasonable amount and a fair method of distributing monies. The commission may authorize a credit to customer bills, in the amount specified by the commission, to reflect distributions received by the local exchange company from the universal service fund. The commission shall ensure that the method shall promote the emergence of competition in providing local exchange service.

In order to receive funds pursuant to this subsection, the company shall provide essential local exchange service, or its functional equivalent, upon reasonable request throughout the local exchange area of a rural incumbent local exchange carrier, as defined by the federal communications commission on January 1, 2015, at a price not exceeding the price benchmark established in subsection (h) of this section. A telecommunications company which elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this subsection shall receive funds to the extent that its loop costs, as reflected in the company’s most recent annual filing of unseparated loop costs filed with the Universal Service Administration Company, exceed the company’s most recent annual federal universal service funds receipts and annual local revenues. In calculating annual local revenues the commission shall utilize the imputed price benchmark established in subsection (h) of this section. If an otherwise qualified company elects to receive Wyoming universal service funds pursuant to this subsection, but does not file an annual unseparated loop cost report with the Universal Service Administration Company, it shall file the equivalent information with the commission.

       The price benchmark shall be thirty dollars ($30.00) until July 1, 2023 unless otherwise adjusted by the commission pursuant to this subsection. On and after July 1, 2019, the commission shall review the price benchmark one (1) time every four (4) years and, after review, shall adjust the benchmark as necessary to assure that it approximates one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local exchange service price. The commission may change the price benchmark at any time if, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, the commission determines that the price benchmark does not approximate one hundred thirty percent (130%) of the weighted statewide average essential local exchange service price and that the price benchmark should be adjusted by ten percent (10%) or more.

In establishing standards, the commission:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1ai">
         Shall require a public utility to generate a specified percentage of electricity generated to be dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1aii">
         Shall establish a date not later than July 1, 2030 for requiring a percentage of electricity generated by a public utility to be dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity taking into consideration any potentially expiring federal tax credits;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1aiii">
         Shall establish intermediate standards and requirements for dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity that public utilities must generate before the electricity generation standard established in paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this subsection;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1aiv">
         Shall require each public utility to demonstrate in each integrated resource plan submitted to the commission the steps the public utility is taking to achieve the electricity generation standard established in paragraphs (i) through (iii) of this subsection;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1av">
         Shall for each public utility:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1avA">
           Establish baseline standards for electric reliability to ensure that new or expanded intermittent generation resources do not unreasonably diminish power quality or increase momentary outages across a utility’s service territory or in any particular location;
          </li>
          <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1avB">
           Require the utility to monitor and report electric reliability and power quality outcomes in integrated resource plan submissions or as otherwise directed by the commission; and
          </li>
          <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1avC">
           Require the utility to take any steps the commission deems reasonably necessary to maintain reasonable levels of electric reliability and power quality.
          </li>
         </ol>
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1b">
       In addition to W.S. 37-3-117(a), the rates charged by an electric public utility shall not include any recovery of or earnings on the capital costs associated with new electric generation facilities built, in whole or in part, to replace the electricity generated from one (1) or more coal fired electric generation facilities located in Wyoming and retired on or after January 1, 2024, unless the commission determines that the public utility that owned the retired coal fired electric generation facility:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1bi">
         Has satisfied the requirements of W.S. 37-3-117(a); and
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1bii">
         Is achieving or has taken steps to the commission’s satisfaction to achieve the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1c">
       Subject to W.S. 37-3-117(a) and the limitation in subsection (b) of this section, the commission shall consider the following when establishing reasonable rates for a public utility working toward and achieving the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1ci">
         A public utility that generates dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity may apply to the commission for rate recovery of the cost of any carbon capture, utilization and storage technology used to achieve the electricity generation standards established under subsection (a) of this section, including a higher return on equity, provided that the carbon capture, utilization and storage technology is integral or adjacent to a coal fired generation facility in Wyoming;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1cii">
         A public utility may apply to the commission for authorization to allow a portion of any revenues from the sale of carbon dioxide captured, stored or utilized as a result of generating dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity to be returned to the shareholders of the public utility;
        </li>
        <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1ciii">
         To the extent a public utility can demonstrate that it will incur incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard, the commission shall authorize the public utility to implement a rate recovery mechanism that collects a surcharge from customers not to exceed two percent (2%) of each customer’s total electric bill to provide for the recovery of the prudently incurred incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard. A rate recovery mechanism may be authorized and established prior to the public utility incurring incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard and the public utility may retain funds collected through a mechanism in a regulatory account approved by the commission to offset future costs. To the extent the rate recovery mechanism is insufficient to compensate the public utility for its prudently incurred incremental costs to comply with the reliable and dispatchable low-carbon energy standard, the commission shall take such actions as necessary notwithstanding any other provision of this section to ensure the public utility is able to recover its prudently incurred incremental costs and customers are not charged for those incremental costs other than through the rate recovery mechanism.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1d">
       The commission shall promulgate rules to ensure that public utilities are satisfactorily progressing toward achieving the dispatchable and reliable low-carbon electricity generation standard that the commission establishes as required in subsection (a) of this section and achieving reasonable electric reliability and power quality outcomes as required by subsection (a) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t37c18s37-18-102ol1e">
       Beginning in 2023, and occurring every second year thereafter, the commission shall report to the legislature regarding implementation of the electricity portfolio standards and recommend whether it should be continued, modified or repealed. To the extent the electricity portfolio standards are modified or discontinued, nothing shall impair the ability of a public utility that has incurred costs to comply with the electricity portfolio standards to recover its prudently incurred costs as authorized by the commission.
