The policy behind the tolling provision in the statute of limitations was not rescinded by the existence of this section, since only if the plaintiff had known where to find the defendant, which she did not, would this section have operated to permit effective service.

       A statute abolishing two judicial districts and attaching the counties to other districts, permitting the electors of those counties, before the law becomes effective, to vote for a judge in the intended consolidated district, is not in violation of art. 3, § 27, Wyo. Const., prohibiting certain local and special laws. Brown v. Clark, 47 Wyo. 216, 34 P.2d 17, <cite class="wy_code">1934 Wyo. LEXIS 21</cite> (Wyo. 1934).

Const., providing that, “until otherwise provided by law,” the state is divided into three judicial districts, is authority for the legislature to increase or diminish the number of districts, and there are no restrictions except under art. 5, § 21, Wyo. Const., as to the removal of a judge and that the increase in taxable valuation must exceed a certain amount before increases are made. Brown v.

        Motion to dismiss.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it
   was unclear whether the State acted in good faith in moving to dismiss,
   the district court was directed to conduct such proceedings as were
   necessary to determine whether the State acted in bad faith in seeking
   dismissal; docket pressure alone did not permit a district judge to
   deny the State's motion, especially since disservice to the public
   interest had to be found, if at all, in the State's motive, because
   district judges historically sat for each other as necessary. State v. Bridger, <cite class="wy_code">2014 Wyo. LEXIS 193</cite> (Wyo. June 17, 2014).

       Where district judge presided at trial in another district upon an order of the judge of the district wherein cause was pending, he is at least a de facto judge, and where no objection to his authority was made before or during the trial, all objections to such authority are waived.

       District court properly denied a father’s motion for relief from the court clerk’s assessment of an $85 fee because, while the term “transcripts” in the statute at issue, when read in isolation, was susceptible to multiple meanings, the rules of appellate procedure indicated that the transcript mentioned in the statute was not a recordation of testimony, but a record of the proceedings, and the statute required the filing fee even though no transcript of testimony was included in the designated record.

        Judgment by commissioner on merits is invalid. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A court commissioner is without authority to determine on the merits the issues in an action where the judge has been disqualified; the expression “chamber business” in art. 5, § 14, Wyo. Const., refers to such business or proceedings as might be conducted by the judge at chambers, and not to the trial on the merits, and his judgment in such case is invalid for want of jurisdiction. Huhn v. Quinn, 21 Wyo. 51, 128 P. 514, <cite class="wy_code">1912 Wyo. LEXIS 13</cite> (Wyo. 1912).

       District court commissioner had authority to extend time for filing record on appeal, since, under former direct appeal statute, the power was one which the district judge might exercise in chambers.

      </p>
      <p>
       Pursuant to Wyo. Const., art. 5, § 14, and this section, an assignment to a court commissioner to take evidence and make findings in a child support modification proceeding is not improper, but the district court must be apprised of the evidence received and relied upon by the court commissioner in making his findings, and the district court must independently review the evidence and findings in making its decision, with such review being indicated on the record.

       District court commissioner had authority to take evidence and make findings in a custody modification case. May v. May, 945 P.2d 1189, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 131</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

      <p>
       District court afforded unwarranted deference to determinations by court commissioner
   
   and expanded the role of the court commissioner beyond that envisioned by constitution and statute, where no part of the proceedings before the court commissioner was transcribed for review by the district court and the court's order modifying a divorce decree contained only the conclusions of the court commissioner.

       A court commissioner found a party guilty of contempt, and imposed a fine upon him. Thereafter the matter was heard by the court under this section. The act of the court was not in the exercise of a general jurisdiction which it might have to punish for contempt, but was in the nature of a review, and the fact that the court went further in its order than merely to approve the acts of the commissioner, and adjudged the accused guilty of contempt, and prescribed the penalty, did not change the nature of the proceedings, where the order was confessedly based on the commissioner's findings.

       In a divorce case, although a trial court abused its discretion by refusing to allow the use of a substitute reporter to transcribe the proceedings and prepare an official transcript, there was no prejudice shown; the purpose for the time notification was for the convenience of the official court reporter. The error was harmless because a trial transcript was unnecessary since the parties stipulated to all pertinent facts and exhibits upon which the trial court made detailed findings in its decision letters.

     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 6, effective July 1, 2000, provides: “A county having a justice of the peace court on August 1, 1999 which continuously maintained the court on and after that date until the effective date of this act [July 1, 2000], shall continue to have that court on and after the effective date of this act. The county shall continue to pay all costs, expenses and salaries for the court as it did on August 1, 1999. Except as provided in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c09a01s5-9-119" target="_self">5-9-119</a></cite>, a county which continues to have a justice of the peace court on and after the effective date of this act shall not receive the services of the circuit court established under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c09a01s5-9-102" target="_self">5-9-102</a></cite>. On and after the effective date of this act, the board of county commissioners of the county by resolution may abolish the justice of the peace court in that county effective at the conclusion of the term of office of the then presiding justice of the peace. Upon the conclusion of the term of office of the then presiding justice of the peace, the county immediately and for all lawful purposes shall receive the services of the circuit court for the circuit within which the county lies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 8, provides: “The repeal of any statutes by this act shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued, or accruing before July 1, 2000, or any prosecution, suit, or action pending on that day. Except as otherwise provided in this act, every pending prosecution, suit, or action shall be proceeded in, tried, and determined in the circuit court which succeeds to the jurisdiction of the county court or which succeeds to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court.”

     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 6, effective July 1, 2000, provides: “A county having a justice of the peace court on August 1, 1999 which continuously maintained the court on and after that date until the effective date of this act [July 1, 2000], shall continue to have that court on and after the effective date of this act. The county shall continue to pay all costs, expenses and salaries for the court as it did on August 1, 1999. Except as provided in W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c09a01s5-9-119" target="_self">5-9-119</a></cite>, a county which continues to have a justice of the peace court on and after the effective date of this act shall not receive the services of the circuit court established under W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t05c09a01s5-9-102" target="_self">5-9-102</a></cite>. On and after the effective date of this act, the board of county commissioners of the county by resolution may abolish the justice of the peace court in that county effective at the conclusion of the term of office of the then presiding justice of the peace. Upon the conclusion of the term of office of the then presiding justice of the peace, the county immediately and for all lawful purposes shall receive the services of the circuit court for the circuit within which the county lies.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 8, provides: “The repeal of any statutes by this act shall not affect any act or offense done or committed, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any right established, accrued, or accruing before July 1, 2000, or any prosecution, suit, or action pending on that day. Except as otherwise provided in this act, every pending prosecution, suit, or action shall be proceeded in, tried, and determined in the circuit court which succeeds to the jurisdiction of the county court or which succeeds to the jurisdiction of the justice of the peace court.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 9, provides: “On and after the effective date of this act, each circuit court shall consist of the county courts geographically located within a judicial district in existence on the effective date of this act. All judicial business pending before any county court shall be considered to be pending before the circuit court, and the circuit court judges shall in all respects be the judicial successors in office of all the county court judges and county courts of the county. All judicial files, records, and dockets belonging to or appertaining to the office of the county court judges and county courts of the counties shall be filed in the appropriate office of the circuit court and safely kept therein, or may be stored and shall in all respects constitute records of the circuit court.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Laws 2000, ch. 24, § 10, provides: “On and after the effective date of this act, a county court judge holding office on the effective date of this act shall become a circuit court judge of the circuit court in the judicial district in which he was a county court judge and shall perform the duties of a circuit court judge as provided in this act. The term of office of a circuit court judge who holds that office under this section shall expire on the date his term of office as a county court judge would have expired. He shall be considered an incumbent in the office of circuit court judge, and thus, he shall stand for retention in office as circuit court judge.”

       By the term “criminal cases” is meant cases in violation of the laws of the state. When a case of violation of an ordinance reaches the district court on appeal, the violation of such ordinance is considered to be on the same footing as a crime under the criminal laws of the state and must, under this section, be tried in the same manner. Trials under the criminal law of this state are jury trials not only when the case originates in the district court, but also when it originates in a justice court and is then appealed, for on the appeal the trial is de novo.
