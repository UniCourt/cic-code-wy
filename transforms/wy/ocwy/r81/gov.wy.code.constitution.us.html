    <p>
     In May, 1785, a committee of Congress made a report recommending an alteration in the Articles of Confederation, but no action was taken on it, and it was left to the state legislatures to proceed in the matter. In January, 1786, the legislature of Virginia passed a resolution providing for the appointment of five commissioners, who, or any three of them, should meet such commissioners as might be appointed in the other states of the Union, at a time and place to be agreed upon, to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony; and to report to the several states such an act, relative to this great object, as, when ratified by them, will enable the United States in Congress effectually to provide for the same. The Virginia commissioners, after some correspondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time and the city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other states were represented, viz.: Delaware, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the circumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present agreed upon a report (drawn by Mr. Hamilton of New York) expressing their unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance the interests of the Union if the states by which they were respectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure the concurrence of the other states, in the appointment of commissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday of May following, to take into consideration the situation of the United States; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the federal government adequate to the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that purpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to by them and afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state, would effectually provide for the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Congress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor of a convention, and the legislatures of those states which had not already done so (with the exception of Rhode Island) promptly appointed delegates. On the 25th of May, seven states having convened, George Washington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the consideration of the proposed constitution was commenced. On the 17th of September, 1787, the constitution, as engrossed and agreed upon was signed by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts, and Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the convention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating how the proposed federal government should be put in operation, and an explanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed the constitution so framed, with the resolution and letter concerning the same, to “be transmitted to the several legislatures in order to be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.”
    </p>
    <p>
     On the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing the operation of government under the new constitution, it had been ratified by the conventions chosen in each state to consider it, as follows: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 19, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.
    </p>
    <p>
     The President informed Congress, on the 28th day of January, 1790, that North Carolina had ratified the constitution November 21, 1789; and he informed Congress on the first of June, 1790, that Rhode Island had ratified the constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, ratified the constitution January 10, 1791, and was on March 4, 1791, by an act of congress approved February 18, 1791, “received and admitted into this Union as a new and entire member of the United States.”

       Section 1 Executive Power, Election, Qualifications of the President.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
     </p>
     <p>
      [The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.]
     </p>
     <p>
      The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      In case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—“I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”

      The Eleventh Amendment to the constitution of the United States was submitted to the legislatures of the several states by the third congress on the 4th of March, 1794, and was declared to have been ratified in a message for the president to congress dated the 8th of January, 1798, when 12 authenticated ratifications had been received. In fact, however, it had been adopted by the required 12 states as early as the 7th of February, 1795: Connecticut (May 8, 1794); Delaware (January 23, 1795); Georgia (November 29, 1794); Kentucky (December 7, 1794); Maryland (December 26, 1794); Massachusetts (June 26, 1794); New Hampshire (June 16, 1794); New York (March 27, 1794); North Carolina (February 7, 1795); Rhode Island (March 31, 1794); Vermont (between October 9 and November 9, 1794); and Virginia (November 18, 1794). South Carolina ratified on December 4, 1797, prior to the president’s message.
     </p>
     <p>
      It resulted from the decision in the case of Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 1 L. Ed. 440, 1793 U.S. LEXIS 249 (1793), in which it was held that a state was suable in the supreme court by individual citizens of another state.
