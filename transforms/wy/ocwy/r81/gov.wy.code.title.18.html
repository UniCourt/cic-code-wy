The effect of said provision in the act creating the new county was merely to continue the new county as a part of the original county or counties until its organization for election purposes, as to such elections only conducted by the old county that would necessarily be participated in by the electors within the territory of the new county if no provision had been made for the creation of such new county, and, hence, the provisions of the general law for the organization of new counties applies to any election pertaining to the pending or proposed organization of the new county, occurring after the appointment of the commissioners to organize the same.

      The court to which the report is made shall determine the proportion of the existing indebtedness which the new county shall bear under the provisions of W.S. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t18c01a03s18-1-316" target="_self">18-1-316</a></cite> after deducting the new county’s proportionate share of the value of the public property, money and credits of the original county. The court, if any of the public property is located within the limits of the new county, may apportion its value to the new county, and shall order the board of county commissioners of the new county to issue warrants in the amount of their proportionate share payable to the original county when the new county’s proportionate share of the indebtedness and interest is due. The proportion of indebtedness of the new county is a lien upon the taxable property of the new county.

       Where county commissioners contracted with attorneys to defend county in court actions, allowed claim for retainer and issued certificates of indebtedness, but later passed resolution that attorneys had not rendered service, cancelled certificates and ordered treasurer not to pay them, allowance of claim and issuance of certificates did not preclude county from contesting the claim, as certificates are merely orders on the treasurer to pay when funds available and may be revoked and payment stopped if later a defense develops which justifies recision of contract.

Prior to the enactment of ch. 45, Laws 1882, the first part of this section provided as follows: “Each county attorney shall receive such fees as may be allowed him by law, ….” Section 18, ch. 45, Laws 1882, provided a salary and fee schedule for county and prosecuting attorneys. As a result the compilers of the 1899 Revised Statutes inserted the words “and prosecuting” and “or salary or both.” The salary and fee schedule fixed by the 1882 act is now obsolete.

        Nature of duties imposed by law. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       When duties are imposed upon a public officer, such as a county clerk, by law rather than by some appointing power, such duties are usually governmental and not ministerial. Denver Buick v. Pearson, 465 P.2d 512, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 157</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       <b>
        When county clerk's bond protects; ministerial duties. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       A county clerk's bond protects if the official misappropriates public funds, because there would be no immunity in such a case. It also protects when a county clerk or his deputies default in the performance of ministerial duties. A duty is ministerial when the law prescribes the mode and occasion of its performance with such certainty that nothing is left to judgment or discretion — a duty not involving official discretion. Spaniol Ford, Inc. v. Froggatt, 478 P.2d 598, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 216</cite> (Wyo. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The issuance of a certificate of title
   
   to a motor vehicle by a county clerk is a governmental function. Spaniol Ford, Inc. v. Froggatt, 478 P.2d 598, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 216</cite> (Wyo. 1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The county clerk is cloaked with governmental immunity
   
   in the performance of such a duty. Spaniol Ford, Inc. v. Froggatt, 478 P.2d 598, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 216</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       <b>
        Bonding company not liable if principal is immune from suit. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no authority in this state for holding a county clerk's bonding company liable for an act or default of the county clerk when the county clerk is immune from suit. It would be an anomaly to hold the bonding company liable if its principal is not liable. Spaniol Ford, Inc. v. Froggatt, 478 P.2d 598, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 216</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       <b>
        Liability on county clerk's bond. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       There can be no liability on a county clerk's bond unless the county clerk is liable for some default. In the absence of a statute imposing liability, a clerk is not liable for defaults or negligent acts of himself or deputies in the performance of governmental duties imposed by statute. Spaniol Ford, Inc. v. Froggatt, 478 P.2d 598, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 216</cite> (Wyo. 1970).

       Although no detailed agenda was required for administrative meetings of board of county commissioners with its staff, county clerk was required to attend executive sessions to make minutes and preserve a record of those meetings.

      </p>
      <p>
       There can be no liability on a county clerk's bond unless the county clerk is liable for some default. In the absence of a statute imposing liability, a clerk is not liable for defaults or negligent acts of himself or deputies in the performance of governmental duties imposed by statute.

        When county clerk's bond protects; ministerial duties. —

      </p>
      <p>
       A county clerk's bond protects if the official misappropriates public funds, because there would be no immunity in such a case. It also protects when a county clerk or his deputies default in the performance of ministerial duties. A duty is ministerial when the law prescribes the mode and occasion of its performance with such certainty that nothing is left to judgment or discretion — a duty not involving official discretion.

       In an action to fix the liabilities and property between an old and a new county carved therefrom, this section was cited to the effect that there was no provision therein for apportioning the cost of the new county in securing the records.

        Rule that subsequent grantee not required to search records anterior to vesting of title in his grantor not applicable in view of this section. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule that a subsequent grantee is not required to search the records in point of time anterior to the vesting of the legal title in his grantor is based on the reason that a duty should not be imposed on him of examining the records indefinitely. Such rule does not apply in this state since this section <cite class="octn"><a href="#t18c03a04s18-3-402" target="_self">18-3-402</a></cite> requires an abstract of each and every instrument left for record, so that anyone interested in any tract of land may turn to the proper page of the abstract, and find almost at a glance, a description of every instrument, whether anterior or subsequent to the vesting of the legal title in his grantor.

Additional offices created under this subsection shall be filled at the general election next following the election at which the increase was approved. At that general election, not more than one (1) commissioner shall be elected for a term of two (2) years, and the election ballots shall so state. Each term shall otherwise be four (4) years.

To be counted the electors shall be registered voters when the completed petition is submitted for verification. The number of electors required shall be determined by the number of votes cast at the last general election. The election shall be at the direction and under the supervision of the county clerk.

At the election the ballots shall contain the words “for increasing the membership of the board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members”, and “against increasing the membership of the board of county commissioners from three (3) to five (5) members”.

The proposition for districting shall be submitted to a vote in the manner provided by subsections (c) and (d) of this section. At the election, the ballot shall contain the words “for dividing the county into five (5) county commissioner election districts” and “against dividing the county into five (5) county commissioner election districts”. The proposition to increase the number of county commissioners and the proposition for districting may appear on the ballot at the same general election, however the ballots shall state that the proposition for districting is contingent upon approval of the proposition to increase the number of commissioners. The petition required by subsection (c) of this section may contain both the proposition to increase the number of commissioners and the proposition for districting, or the propositions may be circulated and submitted on separate petitions. If the proposition for districting is not approved, the commissioners shall represent the county on at-large basis.

The districting plan shall be made before March 1 next following the election at which the proposition for districting is approved and shall be effective as of March 1 the following year. The districting plan may provide that any commissioner elected after the effective date of the districting plan shall reside in and represent the district from which he is elected by the electors of that district, and, beginning January 1, 2012, that commissioners may serve at large or that district representation may be apportioned in any combination of single member, multi-member and at large representation, provided that in all cases commissioners represent a population as nearly equal as is practicable considering the geographic, economic and social characteristics of the county. Commissioners in office on the effective date of the districting plan shall serve the county at large until the regular expiration of their term. The districting plan shall designate which districts shall elect county commissioners in the general election next following the effective date of the districting plan. In any county in which the voters approved increasing the number of commissioners and districting at the same election, the districting plan shall also designate which district shall elect a county commissioner at the next general election for a term of two (2) years, as provided by subsection (b) of this section. The ballot shall state the term in the designated district to be for two (2) years. Thereafter, all terms shall be four (4) years.

   an election in which voters passed a proposition returning the size
   of the county commission to three and (2) direct the county clerk
   to hold an election based on a board composed of five members. The
   remedy sought would have defeated the public interest in the stability
   and finality of election results and could only result from a declaration
   that the special election was void, which was the very essence of
   an election contest. Rock v. Lankford, 2013 WY 61, 301 P.3d 1075, <cite class="wy_code">2013 Wyo. LEXIS 66</cite> (Wyo. 2013).

       Each board of county commissioners may except where expressly prohibited by law authorize any county officer, agent or employee to accept negotiable paper as defined in subsection (c) of this section including paper arising from the use of a lender credit card as defined in W.S. 40-14-140(a)(ix) in payment of any tax, assessment, license, permit, fee, fine or other money owing to the county or collectible by the county in behalf of the state or other unit of government, or in payment of any bail deposit or other trust deposit. Any fees assessed for processing a credit card payment may be borne by the county or person tendering payment. Any fees assessed for processing a credit card payment collected on behalf of the state shall be borne by the county or person tendering payment and not by the state. With respect to lender credit card transactions the county is entitled to promptly present all negotiable paper to the bank upon which the negotiable paper is drawn for payment without any right of setoff or defense on the part of the issuer except as follows:
       <ol type="i">
        <li id="t18c03a05s18-3-505ol1ai">

       Any defense, claim or action that an individual using negotiable paper or a lender credit card might have against issuers of the card shall not apply to the county, its officers, agents or employees or relieve the individual of responsibility for payment.

      <li id="t18c03a05s18-3-505ol1c">
       As used in this section “negotiable paper” means money orders, checks and drafts, including, without limitation, sales drafts and checks and drafts signed by a holder of a lender credit card issued by a bank maintaining a revolving loan account as defined in W.S. 40-14-308, for lender credit card holders.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c03a05s18-3-505ol1d">
       Any county officer, agent or employee who accepts negotiable paper pursuant to and in conformity with authorization from the board of county commissioners is not personally liable if the paper is dishonored. Any losses arising from dishonored paper shall be allocated to the respective funds for which the negotiable paper was accepted. In the event of losses from dishonored paper when the county or any of its officers are collecting funds for the state or any other level or unit of government, such losses shall be allocated to and accepted by the governmental entity for whom the collections were made.
      </li>
      <li id="t18c03a05s18-3-505ol1e">
       The acceptance of negotiable paper constitutes conditional payment for the amount owing. If the paper is not dishonored the payment shall be effective on the date the paper was accepted by the county officer, agent or employee. If the paper is dishonored in the course of collection the conditional payment is of no effect and any receipt, certificate or license issued upon acceptance of the negotiable paper is void. In the event any property including motor vehicle license plates is transferred or issued by the county or any of its officers, agents or employees upon acceptance of negotiable paper, and the paper is subsequently dishonored the county may rescind the transaction and a sheriff or other law enforcement officer may without prior court proceedings seize the property. Neither the rescission nor seizure relieves the person presenting the negotiable paper from further civil or criminal liabilities as may be provided by law.

       Where county commissioners contracted with attorney to defend county in court actions, allowed claim for retainer and issued certificates of indebtedness, which were registered and assigned by payees for value, but later passed resolution to effect that attorneys had not rendered service, cancelled certificates and ordered treasurer not to pay them, allowance of claim and issuance of certificates did not preclude county from contesting claim, as certificates are merely orders on the treasurer to pay when funds available, and may be revoked and payment stopped if later a defense develops which justifies rescission of contract. Treasurer in mandamus action may plead the resolution and order of commissioners as his defense. State ex rel. Robertson Inv. Co. v.

        Ordinary newspaper not privileged over tabloid. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The aim of a statute relating to legal publications is, or should be, to have these publications made in a newspaper which is of general circulation in the community, so as to be generally read and so that the contents of the notice may be brought home to the public generally. No reason exists to give the publisher of an ordinary and standard newspaper a special privilege over that granted to the publisher of a tabloid newspaper if legal notices inserted in the newspaper of the latter subserve that general aim and the tabloid newspaper is regularly published for the length of time required by this section and has the required circulation. Pirie v. Kamps, 68 Wyo. 83, 229 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1951 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       Giving a strict and the ordinary construction to the term “page,” as used in this section, a tabloid newspaper would not be a legal newspaper
   
   within the meaning of this section, although that might not be true if it is liberally construed. Pirie v. Kamps, 68 Wyo. 83, 229 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1951 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       But whether a newspaper is one of general circulation is a matter of substance and not of size.
   
   Pirie v. Kamps, 68 Wyo. 83, 229 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1951 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section prescribes under what circumstances a published notice shall have the effect of a legal notice.
   
   The legislature has undoubtedly the right, in exercising the sovereign or police power of the state, to make reasonable regulations in regard to legal notices. The publication thereof is not a right, but at most a privilege, which the legislature bestows, and which it can modify or take away. In re Gillette Daily Journal, 44 Wyo. 226, 11 P.2d 265, <cite class="wy_code">1932 Wyo. LEXIS 20</cite> (Wyo. 1932); Pirie v. Kamps, 68 Wyo. 83, 229 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1951 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not prohibit the entering into a contract between the owner of a tabloid newspaper and the plaintiff or anyone else.
   
   Whether or not a publication made pursuant to such contract shall have the effect of a legal notice is a collateral matter. Still, to say that the right to have a notice published in a certain paper, and have it recognized as a legal notice, is part of the liberty of the people under art. 1, § 6, Wyo. Const., possibly stretches the term “liberty” too far. Pirie v. Kamps, 68 Wyo. 83, 229 P.2d 927, <cite class="wy_code">1951 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1951).

       Statute providing undersheriff becomes sheriff upon vacancy in office of sheriff is read in pari materia with sections giving county commissioners power of appointment upon vacancy, providing that every elective office becomes vacant upon death or resignation, and relating to sheriff's bonds, indicates legislative intent that undersheriff act as sheriff only while vacancy exists.

       Statute providing undersheriff becomes sheriff upon vacancy in office of sheriff is read in pari materia with sections giving county commissioners power of appointment upon vacancy, providing that every elective office becomes vacant upon death or resignation, and relating to sheriff's bonds, indicating legislative intent that undersheriff act as sheriff only while vacancy exists.

      <p>
       Section <cite class="octn"><a href="#t18c03a06s18-3-611" target="_self">18-3-611</a></cite> creates a property right in the position of a full-time deputy sheriff by requiring that any termination of employment be for cause and after notice and opportunity for a hearing. In addition to the statutory requirements for notice and opportunity to be heard, there is then a federal constitutional right to due process of law that demands notice of the cause for termination and a hearing on the existence of the cause prior to terminating employment of a full-time deputy sheriff. Lucero v. Mathews, 901 P.2d 1115, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 156</cite> (Wyo. 1995), reh'g denied, <cite class="wy_code">1995 Wyo. LEXIS 181</cite> (Wyo. Sept. 26, 1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section imposed a substantive limitation on sheriff's discretion to reduce rank of a deputy sheriff, and thus deputy sheriff had a protected property interest in continued employment at his rank of lieutenant.

      </p>
      <p>
       Deputy sheriff failed to show that his property right in continued employment at his rank was clearly established at time sheriff reduced his rank, and therefore sheriff was entitled to qualified immunity from deputy sheriff's civil rights suit.

        Charged with embezzlement. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk of the district court, notwithstanding duty to pay over receipts each month, was properly charged with embezzlement of year's collections, due when demanded, evidence not showing embezzlement until noncompliance with demands. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence made at least prima facie case that clerk of district court, charged with embezzlement, actually collected amounts certified by him, for which he gave checks to treasurer. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports of clerk of the district court, certifying earnings of his office, were competent in embezzlement prosecution. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).

        Demand. —

      </p>
      <p>
       Demand may be made by either county commissioner or treasurer. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Demands on clerk of district court, last of which was demand for all money due, could be treated as continuous transaction; hence noncompliance with each demand was not separate crime under embezzlement statute. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand by county clerk pursuant to county commissioners' request was sufficient. State v. Campbell, 42 Wyo. 252, 293 P. 365, <cite class="wy_code">1930 Wyo. LEXIS 49</cite> (Wyo. 1930), overruled, Howard v. State, 762 P.2d 28, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 117</cite> (Wyo. 1988).

       Where county commissioners contracted with attorneys to defend county in court actions, allowed claim for retainer and issued certificates of indebtedness, which were registered and assigned by payees for value, but later passed resolution to effect that attorneys had not rendered service, cancelled certificates and ordered treasurer not to pay them, allowance of claim and issuance of certificates did not preclude county from contesting the claim, as certificates are merely orders on the treasurer to pay when funds available, and may be revoked and payment stopped if later a defense develops which justifies recision of contract. Treasurer in a mandamus action may plead the resolution and order of commissioners as his defense. State ex rel. Robertson Inv. Co. v.

       To promote the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the county, each board of county commissioners may regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings and structures and the use, condition of use or occupancy of lands for residence, recreation, agriculture, industry, commerce, public use and other purposes in the unincorporated area of the county. However, nothing in W.S. 18-5-201 through 18-5-208 shall be construed to contravene any zoning authority of any incorporated city or town. No zoning resolution or plan shall prevent any use or occupancy reasonably necessary to the extraction or production of the mineral resources in or under any lands subject thereto. No board of county commissioners shall require that a land use or physical development be consistent with a local land use plan unless the applicable provisions of the local land use plan have been incorporated into the local zoning regulations. Nothing in W.S. 18-5-201 through 18-5-208 shall be construed to allow any board of county commissioners, through the establishment of minimum lot size requirements or otherwise, to prevent residential or agricultural uses authorized for land divisions that are exempt from subdivision requirements pursuant to W.S. 18-5-303(a)(i). No zoning resolution or plan shall regulate and restrict the location and use of buildings and structures and the use, condition of use or occupancy of lands for the use of a private school as defined in W.S. 21-4-101(a)(iii) in any manner different from a public school, provided that the private school:

       This article must be applied in such a way as to reasonably restrict the actions of boards of county commissioners. At the same time, however, to make the theories of planning meaningful, there must be a means to prevent changes in the conditions of a county pending the formulation of a comprehensive plan under § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t18c05a02s18-5-202ol1b" target="_self">18-5-202(b)</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Under the supreme court's construction of subsection (c) of this section, a freeze resolution may initially continue only for a length of time which affords an opportunity to give notice and hold a hearing on the issue of whether or not such a resolution should be given more permanent status under that subsection. Schoeller v. Board of County Comm'rs, 568 P.2d 869, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

       The board must be diligent in formulating a comprehensive plan, when there is an interim freeze resolution in effect,
   
   in order to minimize the possible deprivation of property rights. Schoeller v. Board of County Comm'rs, 568 P.2d 869, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

       No authority exists in this article which permits county commissioners to freeze the land use of an entire county for 5 years
   
   under the guise that some kind of a continuing emergency exists — all without compliance with the notice and hearing provisions of the law. Schoeller v. Board of County Comm'rs, 568 P.2d 869, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

      <p>
       Although the county commissioners' “emergency” resolution of August 24, 1971, freezing existing land use in Park County without previously publishing a notice and holding a public meeting as provided by law, was initially a valid exercise of its implied power to do those things which would make its express power to regulate and restrict the use of buildings and land in unincorporated areas of the county meaningful, this temporary land freeze became, by extension, by resolution, a permanent land plan, which, under the statutes of this state, cannot be implemented without complying with the provisions with respect to public notice and hearing. As a result, the various subsequent resolutions, passed without compliance with the statutes and which extended for some 5 years the original land freeze, were invalid. Schoeller v. Board of County Comm'rs, 568 P.2d 869, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 314</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

       District court imposed a fine on a property owner for 242 days in connection with the owner's violation of a county's habitable space regulation, even though it was evident that the owner's violation of the regulation continued for a considerably longer time than 242 days. The district court was required to impose a fine for each day the owner's violation continued, and the record did not reflect a stipulation by the county that the fine should be imposed for a lesser period of time.

       Evidence of a sale that was going to occur after unlawful conveyances had been made was irrelevant to the charges of unlawful subdivision filed against defendant; the later sale was a separate and distinct transaction, completely unrelated to the transactions for which defendant was convicted. McClellan v. State, 933 P.2d 461, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 31</cite> (Wyo. 1997).

       Evidence was sufficient to support a conviction for unlawful subdivision of land. McClellan v. State, 933 P.2d 461, <cite class="wy_code">1997 Wyo. LEXIS 31</cite> (Wyo. 1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's multiple convictions and sentences for unlawful subdivision of land did not violate double jeopardy; the case involved three separate illegal transactions with different people and three separate parcels of land, thus making separate charges for each conveyance appropriate.

The appeals court noted that Wyo. Stat. Ann. §§ 34.1-5-103(d), 34.1-5-108(f)(i)-(ii), which expressly governed the LC, reinforced the conclusion that defendant bank was not obligated to plaintiff for any failure of performance in the underlying contract for which the LC was issued.

       A board of county commissioners has a duty to exercise reasonable care in processing and reviewing a subdivision application, and a claim for violating that duty sounds in tort. Pickle v. Board of County Comm'rs, 764 P.2d 262, <cite class="wy_code">1988 Wyo. LEXIS 151</cite> (Wyo. 1988).

       Evidence of a sale that was going to occur after unlawful conveyances had been made was irrelevant to the charges of unlawful subdivision filed against defendant; the later sale was a separate and distinct transaction, completely unrelated to the transactions for which defendant was convicted.

       Defendant's multiple convictions and sentences for unlawful subdivision of land did not violate double jeopardy; the case involved three separate illegal transactions with different people and three separate parcels of land, thus making separate charges for each conveyance appropriate.

A match shall be paid under this subsection by the state treasurer at the time any accumulated amounts actually received by a public library foundation total ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) or more. The match shall be made by transferring from the separate challenge fund account to the appropriate public library a match amount calculated as provided by W.S. 18-7-202(a)(iv).

The number of members of any board of trustees shall be an odd number determined by the county commissioners. The first board of trustees, or additional members to a board of trustees, as soon as appointed shall draw lots for the purpose of determining the term of each member of the board. Up to two (2) members of the original board or additional members of the board shall serve for a term of one (1) year, up to two (2) for a term of two (2) years, up to two (2) for a term of three (3) years, up to two (2) for a term of four (4) years and up to two (2) for a term of five (5) years after their appointment. Terms thereafter shall be five (5) years, consecutively staggered. Each trustee shall serve until the first Monday of July following the expiration of their term and the board of county commissioners annually at their meeting in June shall appoint a successor to the trustee or trustees whose term expires. As soon as the original board has determined the terms of its members they shall organize by electing a president, secretary and treasurer of the board. As soon as they are organized they shall file with the county clerk and the secretary of state a certificate showing their organization, for which filing no fee or charge shall be paid. Upon filing the certificate the board of trustees is a body corporate with power to sue and be sued under the name of “Board of Trustees of the Memorial Hospital of  . . . . . County”. No individual member of the board of trustees is personally liable for any action or procedure of the board. The corporation has perpetual existence and it is not necessary to file any other or further certificate than that filed upon the original organization of the board of trustees.

In approving securities for the investment under this subsection, the board shall be subject to and act in accordance with the provisions of the Wyoming Uniform Prudent Investor Act.

Likewise, the term “recreational facilities” is not specifically mentioned in the Act, but most, if not all, the facilities authorized are recreational in character, and we must assume that the commissioners intend to use the bond funds for such authorized facilities.

       The respective assessment districts each have a separate and distinct duty to improve and maintain property in their district, and claims by one against the other are truly adversarial. There is a “matter in controversy between the parties,” which affords subject matter jurisdiction to the district court and gives it authority to adjudicate such a dispute.
