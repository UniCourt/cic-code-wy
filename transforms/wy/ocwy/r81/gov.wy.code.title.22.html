     Repeal of former title 22. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    Laws 1973, ch. 251, repealed former title 22 and enacted §§ 22.1-1 to 22.1-426 [§§ <cite class="octn"><a href="#t22c01s22-1-101" target="_self">22-1-101</a></cite> to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t22c27s22-27-101" target="_self">22-27-101</a></cite>], constituting a complete recodification of the Wyoming election laws.
   </p>
   <p>
    Annotations from cases decided under former title 22 and other repealed statutory provisions have been placed under comparable sections within this title.
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     History of former title. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The original basic act from which the election laws derived was Laws 1890, ch. 80, §§ 1 to 182, and it covered generally all phases of elections. At the time of the 1945 compilation, almost all of these sections, as amended, were still in effect, although the election laws had been supplemented by a large number of additional independent acts and several sections had been added to Laws 1890, ch. 80, by Laws 1890-91, ch. 68, and Laws 1897, ch. 53.
   </p>
   <p>
    Between 1945 and the 1957 compilation, the legislature enacted a number of statutes relating to elections. Notable among these were the permanent registration act, Laws 1949, ch. 122, and the two election law revision acts found in Laws 1951, chs. 127 and 139. These statutes repealed many of the sections of the 1945 compilation derived from Laws 1890, ch. 80, amended others, and enacted many new provisions which were incorporated in former title 22. Certain provisions of that title were affected by Laws 1953, ch. 166 and Laws 1957, ch. 120. Laws 1961, ch. 235 completely revised chapters 1 to 6, 9, and 11 to 13 of former title 22, as amended by Laws 1959, chs. 101, 167 and 201. After its revision in 1969, former title 22 was subsequently amended by Laws 1963, chs. 100, 157; 1965, ch. 16; 1967, chs. 14, 38, 118, 222; 1969, ch. 206; 1971, chs. 177, 196, 226, 227, 240, 250; 1971 Sp. Sess., chs. 3, 4.

     Constitutionality of former provisions governing minor partyballot access. —
    </b>
   </p>
   <p>
    The former provisions of the Wyoming Election Code governing minor party ballot access were unduly burdensome and, hence, unconstitutional. Blomquist v. Thomson, 591 F. Supp. 768, 1984 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19379 (D. Wyo.), rev'd, 739 F.2d 525, 1984 U.S. App. LEXIS 20277 (10th Cir. Wyo. 1984) (decided under pre-1984 version of former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t22c01s22-1-102ol1g" target="_self">22-1-102(g)</a></cite> and prior to enactment of former § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t22c04a02s22-4-201" target="_self">22-4-201</a></cite> et seq.).

       Candidate's failure to be registered to vote at the time of filing her application for nomination was inconsequential and a mere irregularity since shortly thereafter she reregistered and met all criteria during the primary election, the general election, and at the time she assumed the municipal office.

       One may not be a candidate for municipal office in a city or town without having and maintaining a dwelling or place of habitation physically situated within the municipal boundaries of such city or town.

       Thus, where there was no showing that appellant had a place of fixed habitation within the corporate limits of the city to which she had the intention of returning, she had not brought herself within the statutory qualifications to stand for election in that city.

        Candidate convicted of felony in another state unqualified to run for county commissioner. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court correctly ruled that a candidate, who had been convicted of a felony in another state and who had not had his rights restored in Wyoming, was unqualified to run for county commissioner. The fact that Wyoming might have treated the candidate's conviction as a misdemeanor had it occurred here, and that the candidate did not lose his civil rights in the state of conviction, did not alter this outcome. However, the court erred in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the holding of a special election, as a judgment annulling the election in which the unqualified candidate's name appeared on the ballot was the appropriate remedy. Mills v. Campbell County Canvassing Bd., 707 P.2d 747, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 588</cite> (Wyo. 1985).

State ex rel. Copenhaver v. Jack, 60 Wyo. 405, 153 P.2d 149, <cite class="wy_code">1944 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1944).

       Legislature has never recognized any power in political committees to make party nominations, except as delegated to it either by party convention or legislature. State ex rel. Copenhaver v. Jack, 60 Wyo. 405, 153 P.2d 149, <cite class="wy_code">1944 Wyo. LEXIS 18</cite> (Wyo. 1944).

       Statute does not authorize printing of the name of one person as candidate for presidential elector in more than one place on the ticket, though nominated by two or more parties. State ex rel. Blydenburg v. Burdick, 6 Wyo. 448, 46 P. 854, <cite class="wy_code">1896 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo. 1896).

       Where one of three persons nominated by the Democratic state convention as presidential elector declined and the vacancy was filled by nomination by the state committee of one who had been previously nominated by the People's Party, there was no authority for printing such person's name in more than 1 place on the ticket or for taking it out of the group of People's Party candidates, it being proper to place the words “Democrat and People's” after his name to show he was the nominee of both parties.

In order to obtain a replacement ballot, the voter shall sign a sworn statement specifying the reason for requesting the replacement ballot. The statement shall be presented to the election official no later than 7:00 p.m. on election day. The election official shall keep a record of each replacement ballot issued in accordance with this paragraph. A replacement ballot may be transmitted directly to the applicant at the election official’s office or may be mailed to the voter at the address provided in the application.

If the ballot so qualifies and is otherwise valid, the official shall place a number next to the voter’s name in the poll book.

If the election official determines that a voter to whom a replacement ballot has been issued has voted more than once, the official shall only count the first ballot received from that voter;

        Court errs in directing special election following election with unqualified candidate. —
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       The district court correctly ruled that a candidate, who had been convicted of a felony in another state and who had not had his rights restored in Wyoming, was unqualified to run for county commissioner. The fact that Wyoming might have treated the candidate's conviction as a misdemeanor had it occurred here, and that the candidate did not lose his civil rights in the state of conviction, did not alter this outcome. However, the court erred in issuing a writ of mandamus directing the holding of a special election, as a judgment annulling the election in which the unqualified candidate's name appeared on the ballot was the appropriate remedy. Mills v. Campbell County Canvassing Bd., 707 P.2d 747, <cite class="wy_code">1985 Wyo. LEXIS 588</cite> (Wyo. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a losing candidate in a town council election successfully challenged the election of the winning candidate who was not a registered voter when he filed his petition, the correct remedy was to not void the entire council election but rather to annul the election of the winning candidate and to declare elected the qualified candidate receiving the highest number of legal votes.

      <p>
       The Political Subdivision Bond Election Law appears to be a commendable effort by the legislature in 1973 to make uniform the procedures to be followed when an election is required prior to issuance of bonds of any sort. There is no language requiring an election approval in all instances when revenue bonds are to be issued. Frank v. Cody, 572 P.2d 1106, <cite class="wy_code">1977 Wyo. LEXIS 304</cite> (Wyo. 1977).

       In a challenge to a school district's use of funds obtained from the sale of bonds to construct school facilities, to the extent the challengers' claim challenged the election itself, it was barred as untimely because it was not filed within the 14 day limit for election contests. However, even if the claim was not time barred, there was no defect in the notice provided the public regarding the bond election where the bond questions clearly stated the purpose of the bonds as required by this statute.

      <p>
       Employment as teacher and office as member of board of trustees of school district are incompatible
   
   within the meaning and intent of the common-law rule that a person cannot hold incompatible offices or positions. Haskins v. State, 516 P.2d 1171, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1973).

      <p>
       For person to hold office as trustee while acting as teacher would deprive the citizens of the school district of the independent judgment of a full and impartial board of trustees elected to represent the entire public interest. Haskins v. State, 516 P.2d 1171, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 192</cite> (Wyo. 1973).

       A party who obtained office as a member of the school district's board of trustees while a teacher in that district and who sought to retain both positions was precluded by rule of incompatibility which operated to vacate party's office as trustee rather than position as school teacher.

       Thirty-day period of limitations does not apply to bar constitutional challenges seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from a law adopted by the initiative process. Cathcart v. Meyer, 2004 WY 49, 88 P.3d 1050, <cite class="wy_code">2004 Wyo. LEXIS 62</cite> (Wyo. 2004).

       When a voter contested a city clerk's rejection of signatures on a municipal referendum petition, a district court did not have jurisdiction to hear the voter's declaratory judgment petition under former Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="#t22c24a01s22-24-122" target="_self">22-24-122</a></cite> because that statute was clearly limited to review of a determination made by the “secretary of state or by the attorney general” relating to statewide initiatives and referenda, so it was error for the court to determine that the city clerk acted arbitrarily and capriciously in reviewing the petition as he did.

    Change in boundaries of districts; exclusion of property from district.

     <p>
      Any owner of property that is subject to assessment and payment of tax by a special district, but who is precluded by applicable state or federal law, rule or regulation from using the services provided by the district, may file with the board of county commissioners a petition praying that such lands be excluded from assessment by said district. Petitions shall describe the property which the petitioners desire to have excluded. Such petition must be accompanied by a deposit of money sufficient to pay all costs of the exclusion proceedings. The county commissioners shall cause a notice of filing of such petition to be published, which notice shall state the filing of such petition, the name of petitioners, description of the property mentioned in said petition, and the prayer of said petitioners; and it shall notify all persons interested to appear at the office of said board at the time named in said notice, showing cause in writing, if any they have, why said petition should not be granted. The board at the time and place mentioned in the notice, or at the times to which the hearing of said petition may be adjourned, shall proceed to hear the petition and all objections thereto, presented in writing by any person showing cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted. The filing by such petition shall be deemed and taken as an assent by each and all such petitioners to the exclusion from the district of the property mentioned in the petition or any part thereof. The exclusion shall be allowed if an owner of assessed property is precluded by applicable state or federal law, rule, or regulation from using the services provided by the district. This section shall be applicable only to petitions filed in accordance with the provisions of this section on or before March 31, 1999.
