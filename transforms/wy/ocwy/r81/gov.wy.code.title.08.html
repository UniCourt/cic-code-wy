      The common law of England as modified by judicial decisions, so far as the same is of a general nature and not inapplicable, and all declaratory or remedial acts or statutes made in aid of, or to supply the defects of the common law prior to the fourth year of James the First (excepting the second section of the sixth chapter of forty-third Elizabeth, the eighth chapter of thirteenth Elizabeth and ninth chapter of thirty-seventh Henry Eighth) and which are of a general nature and not local to England, are the rule of decision in this state when not inconsistent with the laws thereof, and are considered as of full force until repealed by legislative authority.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The common law of England has been by statute adopted
   
   as a rule of decision in this state. Goldsmith v. Cheney, 468 P.2d 813, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 164</cite> (Wyo. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whatever of the common law is in force in this jurisdiction is here by the terms of the statute adopting it, enacted at an early day, and incorporated in this section. State v. Foster, 5 Wyo. 199, 38 P. 926, <cite class="wy_code">1895 Wyo. LEXIS 14</cite> (Wyo. 1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Conditions for adoption. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In adopting the common law, it must be applicable to the habits and condition of the society of Wyoming, and in harmony with the genius, spirit and objects of its institutions. Crawford v. Barber, 385 P.2d 655, <cite class="wy_code">1963 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts will adopt principles of common law as rules of decision so far only as those principles are adapted to circumstances within the state, its state of society and its form of government. Fuchs v. Goe, 62 Wyo. 134, 163 P.2d 783, <cite class="wy_code">1945 Wyo. LEXIS 32</cite> (Wyo. 1945).
       </p>
       <p>
        The common law is not exactly the common law of 1607.
   
   Many, and probably most of the rules of the common law of 1607, aside from equitable rules and aside from fundamental maxims, have been modified by judicial decisions. Krug v. Reissig, 488 P.2d 150, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 244</cite> (Wyo. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Common law obtains only when not changed by statute,
   
   and statutes take precedence where there is any inconsistency or conflict with the unwritten law. Schlattman v. Stone, 511 P.2d 959, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 169</cite> (Wyo. 1973); Snell v. Ruppert, 541 P.2d 1042, <cite class="wy_code">1975 Wyo. LEXIS 171</cite> (Wyo. 1975), overruled in part, Ferguson Ranch, Inc. v. Murray, 811 P.2d 287, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo. LEXIS 84</cite> (Wyo. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In construing statutes the rules of the common law are not to be changed by doubtful implication
   
   nor overturned except by clear and unambiguous language. McKinney v. McKinney, 59 Wyo. 204, 135 P.2d 940, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 3</cite> (Wyo. 1943).
       </p>

        <b>
         Meaning of statutes is determined in light of common law. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes are to be construed in harmony with existing law and their meaning determined in the light of the common law. Goldsmith v. Cheney, 468 P.2d 813, <cite class="wy_code">1970 Wyo. LEXIS 164</cite> (Wyo. 1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         When common law abrogated. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        If a statute covers a whole subject matter, abrogation of the common law on the subject will necessarily be implied. In re Roberts' Estate, 58 Wyo. 438, 133 P.2d 492, <cite class="wy_code">1943 Wyo. LEXIS 58</cite> (Wyo. 1943); Schlattman v. Stone, 511 P.2d 959, <cite class="wy_code">1973 Wyo. LEXIS 169</cite> (Wyo. 1973); Snell v. Ruppert, 541 P.2d 1042, <cite class="wy_code">1975 Wyo. LEXIS 171</cite> (Wyo. 1975), overruled in part, Ferguson Ranch, Inc. v. Murray, 811 P.2d 287, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo. LEXIS 84</cite> (Wyo. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Incompatible or useless common-law rule not followed. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court has not hesitated to break new ground and adopt an interpretation that meets the changing needs of Wyoming citizens when a common-law rule has outlived its usefulness or is incompatible with social policy. Nulle v. Gillette-Campbell County Joint Powers Fire Bd., 797 P.2d 1171, <cite class="wy_code">1990 Wyo. LEXIS 102</cite> (Wyo. 1990).

       <p>
        <b>
         Meaning of “judicial decisions.” —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The common law of England of a general nature in force in 1607 is the law of this state, except insofar as it is modified by judicial decisions, and except as it is inconsistent with the law of this state, “judicial decisions” meaning those of all the various jurisdictions, and, among them, we are at liberty to adopt that interpretation which seems best. In re Smith's Estate, 55 Wyo. 181, 97 P.2d 677, <cite class="wy_code">1940 Wyo. LEXIS 4</cite> (Wyo. 1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Use of common law by supreme court. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The adoption of common law by Wyoming was not an adoption of a set code of law. A case must be decided in accordance with the decisions subsequent to the time of James I and the decisions which must govern are not only the English decisions, but other decisions as well, and the supreme court is at liberty to follow any of them or rest its decision upon the fundamental principles underlying all of them. Choman v. Epperley, 592 P.2d 714, <cite class="wy_code">1979 Wyo. LEXIS 389</cite> (Wyo. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Courts may rely upon and follow English decisions. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The common law having been adopted in this state, the courts may rely upon and follow the English decisions so far as they are not incompatible with the statute law. Johnston v. Laird, 48 Wyo. 532, 52 P.2d 1219, <cite class="wy_code">1935 Wyo. LEXIS 52</cite> (Wyo. 1935); Snell v. Ruppert, 541 P.2d 1042, <cite class="wy_code">1975 Wyo. LEXIS 171</cite> (Wyo. 1975), overruled in part, Ferguson Ranch, Inc. v. Murray, 811 P.2d 287, <cite class="wy_code">1991 Wyo. LEXIS 84</cite> (Wyo. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Citation of cases from other common-law jurisdictions. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        It is, and has been, the constant practice of courts in common-law jurisdictions to freely cite cases from other common-law courts. Krug v. Reissig, 488 P.2d 150, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 244</cite> (Wyo. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The supreme court cannot consider the various decisions of courts in other common-law jurisdictions as the law in this state, but considers them as interpretations of the common law, and is at liberty to adopt that interpretation which seems to be the best. Krug v. Reissig, 488 P.2d 150, <cite class="wy_code">1971 Wyo. LEXIS 244</cite> (Wyo. 1971).
       </p>

         Erroneous holdings need not be followed. —
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        While the supreme court cannot legislate, it need not help to perpetuate erroneous holding in case once part of common law of England, but so modified by judicial decisions as not to be part of common law of Wyoming, within this section. Investors' Guar. Corp. v. Thomson, 31 Wyo. 264, 225 P. 590, <cite class="wy_code">1924 Wyo. LEXIS 25</cite> (Wyo. 1924).

       <p>
        The common-law rule that a wife was not entitled to damages for loss of consortium had its genesis in a social, economic and political climate entirely foreign to Wyoming in 1986. Hence, a woman will no longer be denied a cause of action for loss of consortium. However, the trial court should reduce any award to the wife by the percentage of fault attributed her husband, as a cause of action for loss of consortium is a derivative action, and the causal negligence of the injured spouse limits recovery of the claiming spouse under the comparative negligence statute (§ <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.01.html#t01c01s1-1-109ol1bii" target="_blank">1-1-109(b)(ii)</a></cite>).

       </p>
       <p>
        The intention of the lawmaking body to be gathered from the terms of the statute in the light of the objects and purposes intended to be accomplished, is always the controlling factor in the construction of legislative acts. Hoffmeister v. McIntosh, 361 P.2d 678, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 93</cite> (Wyo.), reh'g denied, 364 P.2d 823, <cite class="wy_code">1961 Wyo. LEXIS 114</cite> (Wyo. 1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legislative intent is discernible a court should give effect to that intent. State v. Stern, 526 P.2d 344, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 231</cite> (Wyo. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative intent governs in the construction of statutes, and that intent must be ascertained by reading the statute according to the natural import of the language used without resorting to subtle and forced construction.

       <p>
        It is a fundamental principle of statutory construction that to ascertain the meaning of a given law all statutes relating to the same subject or having the same general purpose shall be read in connection with it as constituting one law. They must be construed in harmony, else the law of the state would consist of disjointed and unharmonious parts with a conflicting and confusing result. Stringer v. Board of County Comm'rs, 347 P.2d 197, <cite class="wy_code">1959 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo. 1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes in pari materia must be compared, harmonized if possible, and if not susceptible of construction which will harmonize their provisions, must operate together so far as possible consistently with evident intent of latest act. Gale v. School Dist., 49 Wyo. 384, 54 P.2d 811, <cite class="wy_code">1936 Wyo. LEXIS 43</cite> (Wyo. 1936).

       <p>
        In construing statutes, words or phrases should generally be given their natural, ordinary and customary meaning. Texas Co. v. Siefried, 60 Wyo. 142, 147 P.2d 837, <cite class="wy_code">1944 Wyo. LEXIS 5</cite> (Wyo.), reh'g denied, 60 Wyo. 174, 150 P.2d 99 (Wyo. 1944).

       <p>
        Where there is plain, unambiguous language used in a statute there is no room for construction, and a court may not properly look for and impose another meaning. State v. Stern, 526 P.2d 344, <cite class="wy_code">1974 Wyo. LEXIS 231</cite> (Wyo. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent of the lawmaker is to be found in the language of the statute, and if it be plain there is no room for construction. In re Brennan, 29 Wyo. 116, 210 P. 939, <cite class="wy_code">1922 Wyo. LEXIS 13</cite> (Wyo. 1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words having a well-settled meaning in the jurisprudence of the country are to be understood in that sense
   
   when used in statutes unless a different meaning is unmistakably intended. Knowledge of the settled principles of statutory interpretation must be imputed to the legislature. In re Dragoni, 53 Wyo. 143, 79 P.2d 465, <cite class="wy_code">1938 Wyo. LEXIS 7</cite> (Wyo. 1938), overruled, Heather v. Delta Drilling Co., 533 P.2d 1211, <cite class="wy_code">1975 Wyo.

        In a case in which the Wyoming Workers’ Compensation Division paid the claimants, who operated air ambulance services in Wyoming, only the amounts permitted by its fee schedule, the Division was required to pay the full amount billed by the claimants because severing the workers’ compensation ambulance provision was consistent with the Wyoming Worker’s Compensation Act’s goal of quick and efficient delivery of medical benefits; as severed, air ambulance charges incurred by an injured worker were covered expenses, and the Division had authority to pay those charges; and, applying the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (ADA), the Division was barred by the ADA’s preemption provision from taking unilateral action to reduce the claimants’ rates.

     <p>
      In amending, altering or repealing any of the laws of Wyoming, it is sufficient to identify each of the laws to be so amended, altered or repealed by designating the particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or other subdivision of the statutes affected by the appropriate number or letter, or by the appropriate chapter and section of a session law if the law to be amended, altered or repealed is not a numbered statute, and it is not necessary to refer by title or otherwise to the original legislative enactment, or amendment thereof, to be so affected. Each bill for an act to amend, alter or repeal any laws in effect, but not yet published, shall refer to the laws by their title and the date of approval by the governor. Nothing in this section shall be construed as altering any rule or requirement that any portion of an enactment being amended shall be set forth in full.

       State could initiate a third degree sexual assault prosecution in 2011 for conduct which preceded the repeal of a criminal statute by more than 4 years because this was permitted under the general saving statute in this section; the saving statute permitted a prosecution for a violation of the law that had been repealed before the prosecution was initiated.

       When making factual findings on remand as to a private road, a board of county commissioners could not retroactively apply amended versions of Wyo. Stat. Ann. § <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.wy.code.title.24.html#t24c09s24-9-101" target="_blank">24-9-101</a></cite> and certify the matter to the district court. This section barred such application, although the amendments were procedural, because it would not prevent a manifest injustice; moreover, allowing the district court to exercise jurisdiction as the fact finding body when it previously had acted in an appellate capacity would lead to absurd results, and the previous remand instructions had not been directed to the district court.

     <p>
      There shall be a great seal of the state of Wyoming, which shall be of the following design, viz: A circle one and one-half (1 1/2) inches in diameter, on the outer edge or rim of which shall be engraved the words “Great Seal of the State of Wyoming.” The design shall conform substantially to the following description: A pedestal, showing on the front thereof an eagle resting upon a shield, the shield to have engraved thereon a star and the figures, “44,” being the number of Wyoming in the order of admission to statehood. Standing upon the pedestal shall be a draped figure of a woman, modeled after the statue of the “Victory of the Louvre,” from whose wrists shall hang links of a broken chain, and holding in her right hand a staff from the top of which shall float a banner with the words “Equal Rights” thereon, all suggesting the political position of woman in this state. On either side of the pedestal and standing at the base thereof, shall be male figures typifying the livestock and mining industries of Wyoming. Behind the pedestal, and in the background, shall be two (2) pillars, each supporting a lighted lamp, signifying the light of knowledge. Around each pillar shall be a scroll with the following words thereon: On the right of the central figure the words “Livestock” and “Grain,” and on the left the words “Mines” and “Oil.” At the base of the pedestal, and in front, shall appear the figures “1869-1890,” the former date signifying the organization of the territory of Wyoming and the latter the date of its admission to statehood.

      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) The legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       “(i) In 2007, the United States Congress, by separate Senate and House Resolutions, declared that a Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day should be established;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ii) The Vietnam War was fought in Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnam and Viet Cong in conflict with the United States and South Vietnam;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iii) The United States became involved in Vietnam because policymakers in the United States believed that if South Vietnam fell to a communist government, communism would spread throughout the rest of southeast Asia;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(iv) Members of the United States armed forces began serving in an advisory role to the South Vietnamese in 1961;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(v) As a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on August 2 and 4, 1964, the United States overwhelmingly passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 99-408), on August 7, 1964, which effectively handed over the war-making powers to President Johnson until such time as “peace and security” had returned to Vietnam;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vi) In 1965, there were eighty thousand (80,000) United States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969 a peak of approximately five hundred forty-three thousand (543,000) troops was reached;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(vii) On January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was signed, which required the release of all United States prisoners of war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all United States armed forces from South Vietnam;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(viii) On March 29, 1973, the United States armed forces completed the withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(ix) More than fifty-eight thousand (58,000) members of the United States armed forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than three hundred thousand (300,000) were wounded;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(x) In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those members of the United States armed forces who died or were declared missing in action in Vietnam;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(xi) The Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue among the people of the United States;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(xii) Upon their return home, members of the United States armed forces who served bravely and faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam War were caught in the crossfire of public debate about the involvement of the United States in the war. Many of these veterans were treated with disrespect and their leaders recommended they not wear their military uniform as they returned home;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(xiii) Additionally, many veterans returning home from previous wars or overseas duty, especially Korean War, Gulf War and Cold War veterans, were not properly welcomed home and did not receive the thanks of a grateful state and nation;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(xiv) Our state and nation has learned the value of a simple ‘thank you’ and ‘welcome home’ as shown by the recognition and celebrations for those who are serving in the ongoing War on Terror;
      </p>
      <p>
       “(xv) The establishment of a Wyoming Veterans Welcome Home Day to thank Vietnam and other veterans would be an appropriate way to honor those members of the United States armed forces who were not properly welcomed home following their military service.”
