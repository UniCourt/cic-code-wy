      </p>
      <p>
       “(a) It is the purpose of this act, unless the introduction of the gray wolf into Wyoming is determined by lawful authorities not to have been in accordance with federal law, to provide appropriate state management and control of gray wolves in order to facilitate the removal of the gray wolf from its listing as an experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species in Wyoming and to prevent future listing of the gray wolf as an experimental nonessential population, endangered species or threatened species.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) In providing appropriate state management and control of gray wolves, the state acknowledges the need to fill the current vacuum of management of this species within the state. The state retains all rights to investigate and, if determined by state officials to be appropriate, take legal actions against the federal government relating to the introduction of the gray wolf into the boundaries of this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c)
   In order to accomplish the purposes of this act, the game and fish commission shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with appropriate federal agencies under which the commission and federal agencies shall endeavor to manage the prey base for gray wolves in a manner to maintain a sufficient prey base in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway within the state for at least eight (8) breeding pairs of wolves. The game and fish commission shall endeavor to manage big game populations providing a prey base for seven (7)
   breeding pairs of gray wolves in all other areas of the state in such a manner as to mitigate to the greatest extent possible, adverse effects on opportunities for licensed hunters to take big game.”

      </p>
      <p>
       “(b) In providing appropriate state management and control of gray wolves, the state acknowledges the need to fill the current vacuum of management of this species within the state. The state retains all rights to investigate and, if determined by state officials to be appropriate, take legal actions against the federal government relating to the introduction of the gray wolf into the boundaries of this state.
      </p>
      <p>
       “(c) In order to accomplish the purposes of this act, the game and fish commission shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with appropriate federal agencies under which the commission and federal agencies shall endeavor to manage the prey base for gray wolves in a manner to maintain a sufficient prey base in Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway within the state for at least eight (8) breeding pairs of wolves. The game and fish commission shall endeavor to manage big game populations providing a prey base for seven (7) breeding pairs of gray wolves in all other areas of the state in such a manner as to mitigate to the greatest extent possible, adverse effects on opportunities for licensed hunters to take big game.”

        Relation to Endangered Species Act.

      <p>
       District court erred in vacating rule delisting gray wolf as endangered species in Wyoming on grounds that provision in state's management plan for additional buffer was not legally binding, as nothing in ESA demanded that level of certainty. FSA's decision to delist in absence of legal certainty was compatible with ESA's requirements for monitoring of species after delisting for at least five years and its emergency provisions authorizing DOI to take immediate action to ensure delisted species did not become threatened or endangered again. Defenders of Wildlife v. Zinke, 849 F.3d 1077, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 3, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 3825 (D.C. Cir. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fish and Wildlife Service exercised its judgment in reasonable way in concluding that Wyoming's management plan, which explained how state intended to carry out its day-to-day implementation of its legal obligations, would adequately protect Wyoming's gray wolf population after delisting. Given Congress's direction that state conservation efforts must be considered, their consideration as part of state’s “regulatory mechanism” was hardly contrary to congressional intent. Defenders of Wildlife v. Zinke, 849 F.3d 1077, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 3, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 3825 (D.C. Cir. 2017).
      </p>
      <p>
       Fish and Wildlife Service did not arbitrarily conclude that genetic connectively was currently sufficient and would remain so after delisting pf gray wolves in Wyoming. Nor did Service arbitrarily conclude that Wyoming's unregulated predator area was not significant portion of wolves' range. Defenders of Wildlife v. Zinke, 849 F.3d 1077, 428 U.S. App. D.C. 3, 2017 U.S. App. LEXIS 3825 (D.C. Cir. 2017).

For purposes of assigning points under this subsection, any unsuccessful license applicant failing to apply for a license, or pay the applicable fee in lieu of applying, during the second calendar year shall be considered to be a first year applicant for any subsequent calendar year in which the applicant submits license application for that particular species.

Purchase of a license  entitles the licensee to take any animal, bird or fish provided on  the license within Wyoming at the time, in a place, in a manner and  in an amount as provided by law and the orders of the commission.  At the time of application for a resident license under this section,  the applicant shall provide a valid Wyoming driver’s license or a  copy thereof, or other proof of residency. The commission shall promulgate  reasonable rules and regulations stating what proof of residency is  required so that only bona fide Wyoming residents, as defined in W.S. 23-1-102(a)(ix), receive  resident licenses. For purposes of purchasing a lifetime resident  license under subsection (j) of this section, an applicant shall have  been a resident as defined in W.S. 23-1-102(a)(ix) continuously  for a ten (10) year period immediately preceding the application date.

      <p>
       Subsection (a), requiring nonresident big game hunters who hunt in federal wilderness areas to employ guides, does not violate the equal protection provisions of the federal and state constitutions, nor the privileges and immunities clause of the United States constitution.

       The requirement that a nonresident employ a guide to accompany him into a federal wilderness, in which he has a valid license to hunt, is specifically authorized by the National Wilderness Preservation System Act and regulations, and does not violate the supremacy clause.

       Because Wyo. Bd. Outfitters &amp; Prof. Guides R. &amp; Regs. ch. 3, § 1(e) has the effect of changing the statutory terms “any significant,” as set forth in paragraph (a)(iv) of this section, to “all,” that regulation expands the power of the Wyoming board of outfitters and professional guides by permitting it to revoke a license for violation of any law or regulation which is found to be improper and beyond the power granted to the board; further, paragraph (a)(vi) of this section permits revocation of an outfitter's license for a “substantial” breach of contract while Wyo. Bd. Outfitters &amp; Prof. Guides R. &amp; Regs. ch. 3, § 1(k) permits it to revoke a license for any breach of contract, not just a substantial breach, and, therefore, it too is beyond the power of the board.

      <p>
       Wyoming Board of Outfitters and Professional Guides' decision to revoke an outfitter's license was warranted under this section because the outfitter violated a significant federal law in failing properly to dispose of a dead mule carcass and because the outfitter willfully endangered a client's health and safety by leaving or abandoning her in the wilderness in order to get his livestock back to the trailhead and never returning to check on her well-being or progress.

      <p>
       When looking at the willfulness of an outfitter licensee's conduct, an appellate court's duty is to determine if the evidence establishes intentional, or knowing, or voluntary acts as distinguished from accidental. The term “endanger” has an easily and commonly understood meaning; the plain meaning of “endanger” is to bring into danger or peril. City of Billings v. Wyo.

     </h3>
     <p>
      “Fishing preserve waters” means any artificial or man-made body of water not exceeding one hundred (100) surface acres, lying wholly within the boundaries of privately owned lands, operated for the purpose of permitting the owner to provide fishing facilities for fishermen. It does not include natural streams, natural ponds or waters impounded by the damming of natural streams with a normal stream flow in excess of five (5) second feet. It is unlawful to use such natural waters as a fishing preserve. The sources of water for fishing preserve waters are limited to surface runoff, natural springs, wells, or waters lawfully diverted from a natural stream, or the damming of natural streams with a normal stream flow of five (5) second feet or less.

      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the legality of a search and seizure under this section, the crux of the matter is whether or not under the circumstances a man of prudence and caution would have had reason to believe that wildlife taken or possessed in violation of the laws of this state were present in accused's vehicle. Gilkison v. State, 404 P.2d 755, <cite class="wy_code">1965 Wyo. LEXIS 150</cite> (Wyo. 1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where an officer stopped defendant's vehicle based on an agent's request, suppression was not warranted under the Fourth Amendment and the vertical collective knowledge doctrine because the agent had reasonable suspicion that defendant was a felon in possession of a firearm; this section was irrelevant to the analysis because (1) the court relied on the agent's reasonable suspicion rather than the officer's subjective belief that the officer stopped defendant to investigate a hunting violation, and (2) the statute addressed probable cause to search, not probable cause to stop a vehicle.

       The right granted to search without a warrant refers only to “wildlife.”

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1aii">
         The protection of the wildlife of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances and administrative rules relating to the management of those resources;

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1aiii">

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1aiv">
         Wildlife is valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws and ordinances and administrative rules and regulations of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife as determined by local law;

         Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife and may endanger the safety of persons and property;

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1avi">
         The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states;

         In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than his home state:

         The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (vii) of this article is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the citation, could return to his home state and disregard his duty under the terms of the citation;

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1aix">
         In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in his home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on his way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation;

        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1ax">
         The practices described in paragraph (vii) of this article cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and
        </li>
        <li id="t23c06a03s23-6-302a0Iol1axi">
